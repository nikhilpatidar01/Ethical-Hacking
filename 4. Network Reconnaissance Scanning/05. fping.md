## `fping` â€” Fast Ping Tool for Network Scanning

`fping` is a command-line network utility designed to send **ICMP echo requests** (pings) to **multiple hosts simultaneously**, making it significantly faster and more efficient than the traditional `ping` command when scanning many targets or networks.
It is commonly used by network administrators and penetration testers for live host discovery, subnet scans, and network availability monitoring.

### Key Features of `fping`

* Sends ICMP echo requests in parallel to multiple hosts.
* Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
* Can read hostnames or IP addresses from a file for batch pinging.
* Allows scanning of entire IP ranges or subnets using CIDR notation.
* Reports which hosts are alive, unreachable, or provides summary results.
* Supports customization of timeout, retries, packet size, and intervals.
* Produces easy-to-parse output useful for scripts and automation.
* Requires root or appropriate privileges to send ICMP packets.

Usage: fping [options] [targets...]

Probing options:
   -4, --ipv4         only ping IPv4 addresses
   -6, --ipv6         only ping IPv6 addresses
   -b, --size=BYTES   amount of ping data to send, in bytes (default: 56)
   -B, --backoff=N    set exponential backoff factor to N (default: 1.5)
   -c, --count=N      count mode: send N pings to each target
   -f, --file=FILE    read list of targets from a file ( - means stdin)
   -g, --generate     generate target list (only if no -f specified)
                      (give start and end IP in the target list, or a CIDR address)
                      (ex. fping -g 192.168.1.0 192.168.1.255 or fping -g 192.168.1.0/24)
   -H, --ttl=N        set the IP TTL value (Time To Live hops)
   -I, --iface=IFACE  bind to a particular interface
   -l, --loop         loop mode: send pings forever
   -m, --all          use all IPs of provided hostnames (e.g. IPv4 and IPv6), use with -A
   -M, --dontfrag     set the Don't Fragment flag
   -O, --tos=N        set the type of service (tos) flag on the ICMP packets
   -p, --period=MSEC  interval between ping packets to one target (in ms)
                      (in loop and count modes, default: 1000 ms)
   -r, --retry=N      number of retries (default: 3)
   -R, --random       random packet data (to foil link data compression)
   -S, --src=IP       set source address
   -t, --timeout=MSEC individual target initial timeout (default: 500 ms,
                      except with -l/-c/-C, where it's the -p period up to 2000 ms)

Output options:
   -a, --alive        show targets that are alive
   -A, --addr         show targets by address
   -C, --vcount=N     same as -c, report results in verbose format
   -d, --rdns         show targets by name (force reverse-DNS lookup)
   -D, --timestamp    print timestamp before each output line
   -e, --elapsed      show elapsed time on return packets
   -i, --interval=MSEC  interval between sending ping packets (default: 10 ms)
   -n, --name         show targets by name (reverse-DNS lookup for target IPs)
   -N, --netdata      output compatible for netdata (-l -Q are required)
   -o, --outage       show the accumulated outage time (lost packets * packet interval)
   -q, --quiet        quiet (don't show per-target/per-ping results)
   -Q, --squiet=SECS  same as -q, but add interval summary every SECS seconds
   -s, --stats        print final stats
   -u, --unreach      show targets that are unreachable
   -v, --version      show version
   -x, --reachable=N  shows if >=N hosts are reachable or not

#### Ping a single IP address

```php
fping 192.168.129.80
```

#### Ping a hostname

```php
fping dns.google
```

#### Force IPv4 ping

```php
fping -4 www.google.com
```

#### Force IPv6 ping

```php
fping -6 www.google.com
```

#### Ping multiple IP addresses in one command

```php
fping 192.168.129.80 192.168.129.31 192.168.129.61
```

#### Ping hosts listed in a file

**Create a file `ip.txt`:**

```
192.168.129.80
192.168.129.145
192.168.129.10
192.168.129.144  
192.168.129.800  
192.168.129.31  
192.168.129.61  
192.168.129.80
```

**Run the command:**

```php
fping -f ip.txt
```
> Wireshark Filter for alive : **icpm**

> Wireshark Filter for unreachable : **arp**
 
#### Ping all hosts in a subnet using CIDR

```php
fping -g 192.168.129.0/24
```

#### Ping a subnet with summary statistics

```php
fping -g 192.168.129.0/24 -s
```

#### Show only alive hosts, suppress error messages

```php
fping -g 192.168.129.0/24 -a 2>/dev/null
```

#### Save only alive hosts to a file

```php
fping -g 192.168.129.0/24 -a 2>/dev/null > live-ip.txt
```

#### Show numeric IPs instead of hostnames

```php
fping -n 8.8.8.8
```

#### Ping with retries and custom interval (in milliseconds)

```php
fping -g 122.168.84.1/24 -a -R
```
```php
fping -g 122.168.84.1/24 -a -R -i 10000
```
