## `fping` â€” Fast Ping Tool for Network Scanning

`fping` is a command-line network utility designed to send **ICMP echo requests** (pings) to **multiple hosts simultaneously**, making it significantly faster and more efficient than the traditional `ping` command when scanning many targets or networks.
It is commonly used by network administrators and penetration testers for live host discovery, subnet scans, and network availability monitoring.

### Key Features of `fping`

* Sends ICMP echo requests in parallel to multiple hosts.
* Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
* Can read hostnames or IP addresses from a file for batch pinging.
* Allows scanning of entire IP ranges or subnets using CIDR notation.
* Reports which hosts are alive, unreachable, or provides summary results.
* Supports customization of timeout, retries, packet size, and intervals.
* Produces easy-to-parse output useful for scripts and automation.
* Requires root or appropriate privileges to send ICMP packets.

### Common `fping` Commands

#### Show help or usage information

```php
fping --help
```
# or
```php
fping -h
```

#### Ping a single IP address

```php
fping 192.168.129.80
```

#### Ping a hostname

```php
fping dns.google
```

#### Force IPv4 ping

```php
fping -4 www.google.com
```

#### Force IPv6 ping

```php
fping -6 www.google.com
```

#### Ping multiple IP addresses in one command

```php
fping 192.168.129.80 192.168.129.31 192.168.129.61
```

#### Ping hosts listed in a file

**Create a file `ip.txt`:**

```
192.168.129.80
192.168.129.145
192.168.129.10
192.168.129.144  
192.168.129.800  
192.168.129.31  
192.168.129.61  
192.168.129.80
```

**Run the command:**

```php
fping -f ip.txt
```

#### Ping all hosts in a subnet using CIDR

```php
fping -g 192.168.129.0/24
```

#### Ping a subnet with summary statistics

```php
fping -g 192.168.129.0/24 -s
```

#### Show only alive hosts, suppress error messages

```php
fping -g 192.168.129.0/24 -a 2>/dev/null
```

#### Save only alive hosts to a file

```php
fping -g 192.168.129.0/24 -a 2>/dev/null > live-ip.txt
```

#### Show numeric IPs instead of hostnames

```php
fping -n 8.8.8.8
```

#### Ping with retries and custom interval (in milliseconds)

```php
fping -g 122.168.84.1/24 -a -R
```
```php
fping -g 122.168.84.1/24 -a -R -i 10000
```
