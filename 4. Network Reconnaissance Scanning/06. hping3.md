# `hping3` â€” Advanced TCP/IP Packet Crafter and Network Scanner

`hping3` is a powerful and flexible command-line tool used for crafting and sending custom TCP/IP packets. Unlike standard ping utilities that only send ICMP echo requests, `hping3` supports TCP, UDP, ICMP, and RAW-IP packets with fine-grained control over flags, payloads, headers, and packet parameters.

It is widely used in network diagnostics, firewall testing, port scanning, traceroute-like operations, and penetration testing.

### Key Features of `hping3`

* Supports crafting of TCP, UDP, ICMP, and RAW IP packets
* Allows setting custom TCP flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, URG, PSH, XMAS)
* Useful for TCP/IP stack fingerprinting, firewall rule testing, and network scanning
* Supports port scanning with customizable ranges and packet flags
* Can spoof source IP addresses and ports for testing purposes
* Includes support for traceroute, packet flooding, and network stress testing
* Requires root or administrative privileges to send raw packets

# `hping3` TCP Flags Overview

You can manipulate TCP flags for deep network testing. Each flag serves a specific purpose in networking and security analysis.

| **Flag** | **Name**         | **Purpose & Behavior**                                                                                                                                   | **Use in Scanning / Testing**                                                                 |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `URG`    | Urgent           | Indicates that the segment contains **urgent data**. The **urgent pointer** field tells the receiver where the urgent data ends. It's rarely used today. | Used in **firewall and TCP/IP stack testing**. Some legacy systems may respond differently.   |
| `FIN`    | Finish           | Gracefully closes an existing TCP connection. Sent by a host when it has **no more data to send**.                                                       | Used in **stealth FIN scans**, which can bypass stateless firewalls or simple packet filters. |
| `SYN`    | Synchronize      | Used to **initiate** a TCP connection. It's the first flag sent during the **three-way handshake**.                                                      | Used in **SYN scans** to discover open ports without completing the connection.               |
| `RST`    | Reset            | Terminates a connection **immediately**. Used to refuse connections or forcibly close them.                                                              | Useful to **force-close TCP sessions**, or test **firewall rules blocking RST packets**.      |
| `PSH`    | Push             | Tells the receiver to **immediately forward data** to the application, without buffering.                                                                | Used to test **protocol handling**, network latency, or identify application-specific rules.  |
| `ACK`    | Acknowledgment   | Indicates that the **acknowledgment field is valid**, confirming data receipt in a session.                                                              | Used to **map firewall rules**, bypass NATs, or perform **ACK scans** for filtered ports.     |
| `XMAS`   | Christmas Packet | A packet with **FIN, PSH, and URG** flags all set. It's called "XMAS" because the bits are "lit up".                                                     | Used in **stealth XMAS scans** to identify open/closed ports based on RFC-compliant behavior. |

```php
hping3 -2 -U 192.168.129.51
```

#### FIN flag (stealth scan)

hping3 -F 192.168.129.51
```

#### SYN flag (SYN scan for open ports)

```php
hping3 -S 192.168.129.51
```

#### RST flag (reset packets for closing connections)

```php
hping3 -R 192.168.129.51
```

#### PSH flag

```php
hping3 -P 192.168.129.51
```

#### ACK flag

```php
hping3 -A 192.168.129.51

#### XMAS scan (FIN + PSH + URG)

```php
hping3 -X 192.168.129.51
```

### Additional Notes

* `hping3` **must be run as root** or with `sudo` to craft and send raw packets.
* Flags represent TCP control bits used in various scanning and evasion techniques.
* `-8` or `--scan` enables port scanning; can be combined with TCP flags.
* `--rawip` mode allows sending fully custom IP packets.
