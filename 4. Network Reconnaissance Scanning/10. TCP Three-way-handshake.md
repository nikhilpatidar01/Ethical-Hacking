# **TCP-Three-Way-Handshake-Process** 

 > The TCP three-way handshake is the fundamental mechanism used to establish a reliable TCP connection between a client and a server. It ensures both sides are synchronized and ready to communicate.

### **Step 1: SYN (Synchronize) Packet**

* The client initiates the connection by sending a TCP packet with the SYN flag set.
* This packet contains an Initial Sequence Number (ISN) chosen by the client, which will be used to track the order of data it sends.
* **Purpose:** Request to open a connection.

---

### **Step 2: SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge) Packet**

* The server responds to the client's SYN packet with a TCP packet that has both SYN and ACK flags set.
* The SYN flag means the server agrees to establish a connection.
* The ACK acknowledges the client's ISN by setting the acknowledgment number to **client's ISN + 1**.
* The server also includes its own ISN for the connection.

---

### **Step 3: ACK (Acknowledge) Packet**

* The client responds back with a TCP packet with the ACK flag set.
* The acknowledgment number is set to **server's ISN + 1**, acknowledging the server's SYN-ACK.
* After sending this packet, the connection is established, and both sides can begin data transmission.

---

### **Why Is the Three-Way Handshake Important?**

* **Reliability:** Both client and server confirm they are ready to communicate, synchronize their sequence numbers, and establish connection parameters.
* **Connection Establishment:** Without this handshake, TCP wouldn't reliably ensure both parties are prepared, risking lost or misordered data.
* **Duplicate Data Prevention:** Sequence and acknowledgment numbers help manage data order, ensuring duplicates are detected and avoided.

### **Summary Table**

| Step | Packet Type | Flags Set | Purpose                                       |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | SYN         | SYN       | Client requests connection; sends ISN         |
| 2    | SYN-ACK     | SYN + ACK | Server acknowledges client, sends its own ISN |
| 3    | ACK         | ACK       | Client acknowledges server's SYN-ACK          |

> This handshake underpins TCP's ability to provide a reliable, ordered, connection-oriented communication channel, making it fundamental to network communication and also to many **Nmap scanning techniques** that analyze or mimic these packet exchanges.

# **TLS (Transport Layer Security) Handshake Process**

The TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake is a crucial process that establishes a secure, encrypted connection between a client and a server. This handshake involves several steps where both parties agree on protocols, authenticate each other, and generate session keys for encryption.

---

### **TLS Handshake Process Steps**

#### 1. **Client Hello**

* The client sends a "Client Hello" message to the server.
* This message contains the TLS version supported by the client, a list of supported cipher suites (cryptographic algorithms), and a random value called the **Client Random**.

#### 2. **Server Hello**

* The server responds with a "Server Hello" message.
* This includes the TLS version selected, the chosen cipher suite, and a random value called the **Server Random**.
* The server also sends its **digital certificate**, which contains its public key and identity information to authenticate itself.

#### 3. **Server Authentication and Certificate Verification**

* The client verifies the server's certificate against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
* If required, the server may also request the clientâ€™s certificate for **mutual authentication**.

#### 4. **Client Key Exchange (Pre-Master Secret)**

* The client generates a **pre-master secret**, a random number used to create the **master secret**.
* It encrypts this with the server's **public key** and sends it to the server.

#### 5. **Server Decrypts Pre-Master Secret**

* The server uses its **private key** to decrypt the pre-master secret.
* Now both client and server share the same pre-master secret.

#### 6. **Session Keys Generation**

* Both parties compute the same **master secret** using:

  * Client Random
  * Server Random
  * Pre-Master Secret
* From this, **symmetric session keys** are derived for encrypting and decrypting data.

#### 7. **Change Cipher Spec**

* The client sends a **"Change Cipher Spec"** message indicating future messages will be encrypted.
* Then it sends a **"Finished"** message encrypted with the session key.

#### 8. **Server Change Cipher Spec and Finished**

* The server also sends its **"Change Cipher Spec"** message and encrypted **"Finished"** message.
* Once verified, the handshake is complete.

#### 9. **Secure Encrypted Communication Begins**

* Both parties now securely exchange data using symmetric encryption.

| 2. Server Hello                         | Server responds with selection and Server Random, sends certificate  |
| 3. Certificate Validation               | Client authenticates server's certificate                            |
| 4. Client Key Exchange                  | Client sends encrypted pre-master secret                             |

| 6. Session Key Creation                 | Both create master secret and session keys                           |
| 7. Client Change Cipher Spec & Finished | Client signals encryption readiness, sends finished message          |
| 8. Server Change Cipher Spec & Finished | Server signals encryption readiness, sends finished message          |
| 9. Encrypted Communication              | Secure data exchange begins                                          |

### **Notes**

* **TLS 1.3** simplifies this process by reducing round trips and eliminating some steps, improving speed and security.
* The TLS handshake ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and authentication** between client and server during communication.
* This handshake is **fundamental** in securing:

  * HTTPS connections
  * Email servers
  * VPNs
  * Other secure communication channels over networks.
