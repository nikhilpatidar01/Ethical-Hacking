# 🛡️ Network Penetration Testing (NetPentest)

**Network Penetration Testing** is a proactive cybersecurity strategy to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities in an organization’s internal and external network infrastructure. It gives actionable insight into how attackers might infiltrate your systems.

## 🔍 Types of Network Penetration Testing

---

### 🔐 Internal Network Penetration Testing

**🎯 Objective**
Simulate attacks from within the organization — think rogue employees or compromised internal devices.

**📌 Purpose**
Identify and assess risks lurking inside the network, including potential damage from insiders or breached systems.

**🎯 Typical Targets**

* Internal app servers, DBs, and critical services
* Workstations, employee laptops
* Core infrastructure: switches, internal routers, wireless controllers
* Security appliances and access control systems
* Internal auth mechanisms like **Active Directory**, **LDAP**

---

### 🌐 External Network Penetration Testing

**🎯 Objective**
Simulate attacks from the internet — think black-hat hackers targeting public-facing assets.

**📌 Purpose**
Find vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems that could lead to breaches, malware delivery, or unauthorized access.

**🎯 Typical Targets**

* Perimeter firewalls, edge routers, DDoS protection
* Public web servers, APIs, SaaS apps
* Email servers, SMTP/IMAP services
* VPN gateways, remote access portals
* Cloud endpoints, external IP ranges

## 📊 Key Distinctions

| 🔍 Testing Type | 👀 Perspective   | ⚠️ Focus             | 🎯 Common Targets    |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Internal        | Insider Threat   | Inside Network Risks | AD, internal servers |
| External        | Outside Attacker | Public Exposure      | Firewalls, APIs, VPN |

## 🚀 Modern Network Pentesting Methodology

---

### 1️⃣ Planning & Scoping

* **Define Scope:** IP ranges, domains, systems to include/exclude
* **Set Objectives:** Compliance, red teaming, vuln hunting
* **Rules of Engagement:** Test window, social engineering policy, escalation paths
* **Legal Authorization:** Written permission is a must ⚖️

---

### 2️⃣ Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

* **Passive Recon:**

  * OSINT (e.g. DNS, WHOIS, social media, data breach sites)
  * Google Dorking, job postings, public documents

* **Active Recon:**

  * `Ping sweeps`, `Traceroute`, `Nmap`
  * Map topology, find live hosts and exposed services

---

### 3️⃣ Scanning & Enumeration

* **Network Scanning:** Discover open ports/services
* **Enumeration:** Identify versions, configs, and weak auth
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Tools like:

  * `Nessus`, `OpenVAS`, `Qualys`, `Nexpose`

---

### 4️⃣ Exploitation

* **Controlled Attacks:** Manual/automated using `Metasploit`, `Cobalt Strike`, custom scripts
* **Privilege Escalation:** From low-level access to domain admin
* **Persistence (Optional):** Reverse shells, webshells, scheduled tasks

---

### 5️⃣ Post-Exploitation

* **Data Exfil Simulation:** Prove impact by simulating data theft
* **Lateral Movement:** Access deeper systems (e.g., via RDP, PSExec)
* **Cleanup:** No trace left — restore systems, remove shells/backdoors

---

### 6️⃣ Reporting

* **Technical Report:** Vulnerabilities, PoC screenshots/logs
* **Business Risk Mapping:** Real-world impact explained
* **Actionable Fixes:** Recommendations ranked by risk
* **Executive Summary:** High-level report for non-tech stakeholders

---

### 7️⃣ Remediation Verification

* **Re-Testing:** Validate fixes for critical/high-risk issues
* **Recommend Monitoring:** SIEM, IDS/IPS, and anomaly detection

---

### 8️⃣ Post-Engagement

* **Lessons Learned Debrief:** What worked, what didn’t
* **Knowledge Transfer:** Security awareness, IT hardening tips

---

## 💡 Pro Best Practices

* ✅ **Threat Modeling Integration:** Map likely attacker paths
* ✅ **Social Engineering (If Allowed):** Phishing, vishing, baiting
* ✅ **Zero Trust Audit:** Least privilege, micro-segmentation
* ✅ **Cloud & Hybrid Coverage:** AWS, Azure, GCP, SaaS tools
* ✅ **Continuous Pentesting:** Red/blue/purple teaming, bug bounty programs
