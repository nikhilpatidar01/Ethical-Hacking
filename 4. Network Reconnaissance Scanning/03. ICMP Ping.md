## 🛰️ Ping – The Network Echo Locator

**Ping**, short for **Packet InterNet Groper**, is a go-to diagnostic tool used in networking to verify whether a specific host (IP address or domain) is reachable across an IP-based network. It also helps assess latency (how long it takes for a packet to travel to the destination and back).

---

## 🧾 What is **ICMP Ping**?

**ICMP Ping** is a diagnostic technique that uses the **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** to test whether a device is reachable over an IP network. When you "ping" a device, your system sends an **ICMP Echo Request**, and if the device is online and responsive, it replies with an **ICMP Echo Reply**.

This back-and-forth exchange:

* Confirms **network reachability**
* Measures **latency (round-trip time)**
* Helps identify **packet loss or network issues**

> 🧠 **Key Point:**
Ping is not a protocol itself — it's a utility that leverages **ICMP**, a core part of the Internet Protocol Suite, to function.

---
### 🔧 How It Works (Behind the Curtain)

1. Sends an **ICMP Echo Request** to a target host.
2. Waits for an **ICMP Echo Reply**.
3. Measures response time (round-trip) and checks packet loss, if any.
---

### 🛠️ Primary Use Cases

* ✅ **Connectivity check** — Is the device online or not?
* 🧩 **Troubleshooting** — No reply? Might be down, firewalled, or misrouted.
* ⏱️ **Latency measurement** — Helps measure lag between source and destination.
* 💻 **CLI Usage** — Just run `ping <target>` in any command-line shell with options to customize behavior.
---

### 🤔 Misconceptions Cleared

* "Ping" comes from **sonar terminology**, not some fancy acronym.
* "Packet InterNet Groper" is a **retroactive expansion**, often miswritten as “Gopher.”
* ⚠️ **Gopher** refers to a different, outdated protocol and has no relation to Ping.

## 🌐 Ping Sweep – Hunting for Live Hosts

A **ping sweep**, also known as an **ICMP sweep**, is a method used to identify which hosts are active on a given network range. Instead of checking one IP, it sprays Echo Requests across an entire subnet.

### 🔄 Process Flow

1. Define your **target IP range** (e.g. 192.168.0.1–254).
2. Send **ICMP Echo Requests** to each address.
3. Listen for replies.
4. Log the responsive IPs = **Live devices**.

### 📌 Key Considerations

* 🔐 **Firewalls may block ICMP**, so pings might silently fail.
* 🚨 Excessive sweeps can trigger **IDS/IPS alerts**.
* ⚖️ Only perform sweeps on **networks you own or are authorized to scan**.
* 🧰 Tools: `nmap -sn`, SolarWinds, bash loops, etc.

---
### 🧪 Wireshark ICMP Filters:

* See all ICMP packets:

  ```
  icmp
  ```
* Filter pings to/from a specific IP:

  ```
  ip.addr == 192.168.129.144 && icmp
  ```

> Just start a Wireshark capture, apply the filter, then run a `ping` command in another window. You’ll see the ICMP handshake live — request, reply, timestamps, and more.

## 🧪 Ping in Action – Commands You Should Know

### 🪟 Windows Ping Commands

```bash
ping 192.168.129.80                        # Basic ping check
ping 192.168.129.80 -t                     # Continuous ping
ping 192.168.129.80 -n 50                  # Send 50 ICMP echo requests
ping 192.168.129.80 -l 5000                # Set packet size to 5000 bytes
ping 192.168.129.80 -w 2000                # Timeout after 2000ms (2 sec)
ping 192.168.129.80 -l 5000 -t             # Continuous ping with 5000 byte packets
ping 192.168.129.80 -l 65500 -t            # Infinite ping with max packet size
```

**Options Breakdown:**

* `-n`: Number of packets
* `-l`: Packet size (in bytes)
* `-w`: Timeout (ms)
* `-t`: Ping indefinitely until Ctrl+C

### 🔁 Windows Batch Sweep

```cmd
FOR /L %i IN (1,1,254) DO @ping -n 1 -w 500 192.168.1.%i | FIND "TTL="
```

### 🐧 Linux Ping Commands

```bash
ping 8.8.8.8                                # Basic ping to Google DNS
ping 8.8.8.8 -c 2                           # Send 2 echo requests
ping 192.168.129.80 -s 65500                   # Send large packets (65500 bytes)
ping -I eth0 192.168.129.80 -s 65500 -c 4      # Use eth0 to send 4 large packets
ping 192.168.129.80 -i 10 -c 2                 # Send 2 pings at 10-second intervals
ping 192.168.129.80 -i 10 -c 2 -p 42           # Same as above, with byte pattern 42 (hex)
ping armourinfosec.com                      # Ping with DNS resolution
ping -6 google.com                          # Ping IPv6 hostname
ping -6 google.com -i 10 -c 2 -p 42                    # IPv6 ping with pattern, delay, and count
ping 192.168.129.80 -f                         # Flood ping (root required)
ping 192.168.129.80 -f -s 65500                # Flood with max-size packets (root required)

```

**Options Recap:**

* `-c`: Count of requests
* `-s`: Packet size
* `-I`: Interface to use
* `-i`: Interval between requests
* `-p`: Fill pattern
* `-f`: Flood mode (rapid fire)
* `-6`: Force IPv6

### 🐚 Linux Shell Loop

```bash
for i in {1..254}; do ping -c 1 -W 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from"; done
