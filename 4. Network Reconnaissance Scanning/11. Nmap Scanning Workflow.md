# Nmap Scanning Workflow

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source tool used for scanning networks, finding vulnerabilities, and gathering information about targets. A good Nmap scan isn’t just about running a single command — it follows a clear step-by-step process to collect accurate, useful, and stealthy details about a host or network. Here’s the complete workflow of a typical Nmap scan:

---

## **1. Ping the Host (Host Discovery)**

**Purpose:** To check if the target system is online before performing deeper scans, avoiding wasted time and reducing unnecessary noise on the network.

**How It Works:**
Nmap sends specific packets to the target to elicit a response. If the host responds, it’s marked as “alive” and included in further scanning.

**Common Host Discovery Methods:**

1. **ARP Ping** (Local Networks)

   * Sends ARP requests at Layer 2.
   * Works only on the local subnet.
   * Fast and reliable for LAN scanning.
   * Example:

     ```
     nmap -PR 192.168.1.0/24
     ```

2. **ICMP Ping** (Internet Reachability Test)

   * Uses Echo Request packets (like the `ping` command).
   * Can be blocked by firewalls, so not always reliable.
   * Example:

     ```
     nmap -PE target.com
     ```

3. **TCP Ping**

   * Sends SYN packets to common ports (e.g., 80, 443).
   * Useful when ICMP is blocked.
   * Example:

     ```
     nmap -PS80,443 target.com
     ```

4. **UDP Ping**

   * Sends UDP packets to random ports to check responses.
   * May trigger ICMP “port unreachable” messages, indicating the host is alive.
   * Example:

     ```
     nmap -PU target.com
     ```

## **2. Check the PTR Record (Reverse DNS Lookup)**

**Purpose:** To identify the domain name associated with an IP address.
**Why It’s Important:**

* Reveals target naming conventions.
* Can expose the organization or system role (e.g., `mail.example.com`).
* Helps in mapping network topology.

**How to Perform:**

```
nmap -sL target.com
```

*(Lists targets and performs reverse DNS lookups without scanning ports)*

---

## **3. Port Scanning (Default Top Common 1000 Ports)**

**Purpose:** To identify which network services are accessible on the target.
**How It Works:**

* Sends packets to ports and analyzes responses.
* Categorizes ports as **Open**, **Closed**, or **Filtered**.

**Common Scan Types:**

1. **TCP SYN Scan (-sS)** — Stealthy, does not complete TCP handshake.
2. **TCP Connect Scan (-sT)** — Completes handshake, less stealthy.
3. **UDP Scan (-sU)** — Finds services like DNS, SNMP, NTP.
4. **Full Port Range (-p-)** — Checks all 65,535 ports.

**Example:**

```
nmap -sS -p- target.com
```

---

## **4. Service and Version Detection**

**Purpose:** To determine **exact services** and **versions** running on open ports.
**Why It’s Important:**

* Identifies outdated or vulnerable software.
* Helps tailor attacks or audits to specific versions.

**Example:**

```
nmap -sV target.com
```

**How It Works:**

* Sends specially crafted packets to open ports.
* Analyzes responses against a large database of service signatures.

---

## **5. OS Detection**

**Purpose:** To identify the target’s operating system and device type.
**Why It’s Useful:**

* Reveals attack surfaces specific to that OS.
* Helps in vulnerability mapping.

**Example:**

```
nmap -O target.com
```

**How It Works:**

* Sends multiple TCP, UDP, and ICMP probes.
* Compares timing, flags, and response behavior to an OS fingerprint database.

---

## **6. Save the Output**

**Purpose:** To document results for analysis, reporting, or future comparison.

**Formats Supported:**

* **Normal Output** — Human-readable.
* **XML Output** — For importing into other tools.
* **Grepable Output** — For filtering with command-line tools.

**Examples:**

```
nmap -oN results.txt target.com
nmap -oX results.xml target.com
nmap -oG results.gnmap target.com
```

---

## **7. Optional: Aggressive Scan for Maximum Info**

Combines multiple scanning features in one command:

```
nmap -A target.com
```

Includes:

* OS detection
* Version detection
* Script scanning
* Traceroute

### **Nmap Scanning Workflow – Quick Summary**

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free, open-source tool for scanning networks, finding vulnerabilities, and gathering target information. A proper scan follows a step-by-step approach for accuracy and stealth:

1. **Host Discovery (Ping Scan)** – Check if the target is online using ARP, ICMP, TCP, or UDP ping.
2. **Reverse DNS Lookup (PTR Record)** – Find the domain name linked to the IP.
3. **Port Scanning** – Detect open, closed, or filtered ports (TCP, UDP, full range).
4. **Service & Version Detection** – Identify running services and software versions.
5. **OS Detection** – Determine the target’s operating system and device type.
6. **Save Output** – Store results in TXT, XML, or Grepable format for analysis.
7. **Aggressive Scan (-A)** – Combine OS detection, version detection, scripts, and traceroute in one command.

**Example full scan:**

```
nmap -PR -sS -p- -sV -O -oN scan_results.txt target.com
```
