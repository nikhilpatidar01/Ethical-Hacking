# Nmap Interaction with OSI Model Layers

## 1. Network Layer (Layer 3)

* Sends raw IP packets for host discovery, ping sweeps, and protocol scans
* Manipulates IP packets: fragmentation, TTL (`--ttl`), source IP spoofing
* Supports firewall/IDS evasion using decoys, fragmentation, and custom routing

### Example Commands:

```
nmap -f 192.168.1.1                # Fragmented packets  
nmap -sO 192.168.1.1               # Protocol scan  
nmap -S 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.1  # IP spoofing  
```

## 2. Transport Layer (Layer 4)

* Port scanning (TCP & UDP) with various techniques
* TCP SYN scan (`-sS`), Connect scan (`-sT`), FIN scan (`-sF`), Null scan (`-sN`), Xmas scan (`-sX`)
* UDP scan (`-sU`)
* Service and version detection (`-sV`)
* Firewall/IDS evasion: scan speed control (`--scan-delay`, `--max-retries`)

### Sample Commands:

```
nmap -sS 192.168.1.1  
nmap -sU -p 53 192.168.1.1  
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1  
```

# Network Network Layer (Layer 3 – OSI Model)

The Network Layer (Layer 3) manages routing and movement of packets across networks. Nmap utilizes this layer for advanced discovery and scanning.

### IP Packet Handling

* **Raw IP Packets**: Used for scanning and discovering live systems
* **ICMP Echo Requests**: Used for ping sweeps
* **Fragmented Packets**: Used to evade firewalls and IDS

### Routing & Reachability

* **Route Selection**: Determines optimal paths
* **Custom Gateways**: Specify gateway or source IP using `--source-ip` or `--route-dst`

### Custom IP Packet Manipulation

* **Raw Packet Crafting**: Custom IP packets for different scan types (`-sS`, `-sA`)
* **TTL**: Adjusts time-to-live (`--ttl`) for hop limits or advanced probing
* **Fragmentation**: `-f` option sends fragmented packets

### Firewall & IDS Evasion Techniques

* **Decoy Scanning** (`-D`): Sends spoofed packets to mask real source
* **Custom MTU** (`--mtu`): Sets maximum transmission unit for evasion

### IP Protocol Scan (`-sO`)

* **Protocol Discovery**: Lists all network-layer protocols available by sending protocol packets

### Summary:

Nmap’s Network Layer capabilities allow it to probe, enumerate, and bypass security, providing detailed visibility into topology and host availability using multiple stealth methods.


# Transport Layer in Nmap (Layer 4 – OSI Model)

The Transport Layer ensures reliable end-to-end communication. Nmap leverages this layer for scanning and analyzing network services.

### How Nmap Uses the Transport Layer

#### Port Scanning (TCP & UDP)

* **TCP SYN Scan (`-sS`)**: Half-open scan; sends SYN packets but doesn't complete handshake
* **Connect Scan (`-sT`)**: Completes full three-way handshake
* **Null Scan (`-sN`)**: Sends TCP packets with no flags for stealth

#### UDP Scans (`-sU`)

* Probes services like DNS, SNMP, TFTP
* Slower due to lack of guaranteed delivery and possible retransmissions

#### Service Version Detection (`-sV`)

* After identifying open ports, interrogates them to determine the exact software and version

#### TCP Flags & Evasion

* **FIN Scan (`-sF`)**: Sends TCP packets with FIN flag to detect closed ports
* **Xmas, ACK, Null Scans**: Use different flag combinations to bypass filters

#### Determining Firewall Rules

* **Scan Timing**: `--scan-delay`, `--max-retries` adjust scan speed and packet intervals to avoid IDS/IPS triggering

### Summary:

Nmap’s transport layer functionality enables detailed port and service scanning, OS fingerprinting, and stealthy probing, making it essential for security auditing.

# **IP (Internet Protocol) Header Fields and Their Role in Nmap Scans**
> Nmap manipulates key IP header fields to perform various scan types, optimize detection, and evade security controls. Below is a detailed explanation of important IP header fields and how Nmap uses them:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikhilpatidar01/Ethical-Hacking/Master/4.%20Network%20Reconnaissance%20Scanning/Image/IP%20HEADER.png" alt="IP HEADER">


| **IP Header Field**              | **Description & Role in Nmap**                                                                                                                                      | **Example Nmap Usage**                                   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Version**                   | IP packet version—IPv4 (value 4) by default; IPv6 supported (-6).                                                                                                  | nmap -6 2001:db8::1 (IPv6 scan)                         |
| **Header Length (IHL)**       | Length of the IP header in 32-bit words (default is 5 = 20 bytes); increases with options.                                                                         | Modified in raw protocol scans (–sO).                   |
| **Type of Service (ToS)/ DSCP** | Quality of Service bits affecting packet handling/routing. Can be customized to influence traffic treatment or evade detection.                                    | nmap –ip-options '\x03' 192.168.1.1                     |
| **Total Length (Datagram Size)** | Combined header and payload length in bytes. Larger packets may require fragmentation.                                                                             | Packet fragmentation for firewall evasion with -f.       |
| **Identification**            | 16-bit field to uniquely identify packet fragments for reassembly. Useful in fragmentation evasion or traffic inspection.                                           | Visible in packet sniffing; manipulation occurs with fragmentation enabled. |
| **Flags**                     | Control fragmentation; DF (Don’t Fragment), MF (More Fragments).                                                                                                   | Fragmented scans with -f use these flags to circumvent filters. |
| **Fragment Offset**           | Position of a fragment's data relative to the original packet.                                                                                                     | Packet fragmentation can confuse some IDS/firewalls.     |
| **Time To Live (TTL)**        | Limits packet lifetime (hops). Decremented at each router, preventing routing loops. Used for OS detection and trace.                                              | Set TTL to control detection or analyze network hops (--ttl). |
| **Protocol**                  | Specifies upper layer protocol (1=ICMP, 6=TCP, 17=UDP). Used in protocol scans.                                                                                    | Protocol scan: nmap -sO 192.168.1.1                     |
| **Header Checksum**          | Validates the integrity of the IP header; recalculated with header changes.                                                                                        | Calculated automatically, no user manipulation.          |
| **Source Address**           | IP address of the sender. Can be spoofed to conceal scan origin.                                                                                                  | IP spoofing stealth: nmap -S 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.1  |
| **Destination Address**      | IP of the target system(s). Supports single and subnet notation.                                                                                                   | Examples: nmap 192.168.1.1 or nmap 192.168.1.0/24       |
| **Options**                  | Rare extended features like Record Route, Timestamp. Can increase header size—uncommonly used but supported for advanced scans.                                   | Custom options: nmap –ip-options '\x07\x27\x08\x08\x08\x08' 192.168.1.1 |

## **Additional Details and Usage Patterns**

* **Fragmentation for Evasion:**  
By breaking packets into fragments (`-f`), Nmap attempts to bypass some firewalls and IDS/IPS devices that don’t properly inspect fragmented packets. Fragment offset and flags assist this evasion.

* **TTL Manipulation:**  
Controlling TTL is useful in OS fingerprinting since different operating systems use different initial TTL values. Also aids in evading detection or mimicking traffic from a certain network region.

* **Source IP Spoofing:**  
Spoofing the source IP helps mask the origin of scans, useful in penetration testing or bypassing access control lists that restrict hosts by IP.

* **Protocol Enumeration (`-sO`):**  
This IP protocol scan sends raw IP packets with different protocol numbers to discover what protocols the target supports (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP).

* **Packet Size and Options:**  
Manipulating the size (total length field) and options enables Nmap to craft unusual or custom packets for fingerprinting or firewall evasion.

| **Options**                | Supports features like MSS, Timestamps, or SACK. Nmap allows custom options.                                    | nmap --tcp-options 02:04:4000 192.168.1.1                    |

## **How Nmap Uses TCP Header Fields**

- **Source Port:**  
  - You can set the source port manually with `--source-port`. This can help evade firewalls performing special handling on trusted ports (like port 53 for DNS).

- **Destination Port:**  
  - Choose single ports or ranges to scan using `-p`, e.g., `-p 80,443` or `-p 1-1024`.

- **Sequence Number:**  
  - Used by Nmap’s OS fingerprinting engine (`-O`) because each OS generates Initial Sequence Numbers (ISN) differently.

- **Flags:**  
  - Nmap uses many flag combinations for stealth and evasion scans:
    - **SYN Scan (`-sS`)**: Sends SYN, waits for SYN-ACK or RST.
    - **FIN Scan (`-sF`)**: Sends FIN, useful for bypassing firewalls filtering only SYNs.
    - **ACK Scan (`-sA`)**: Used to map firewall rules.
    - **Null/Xmas Scans**: Use no flags or a combination (e.g., FIN+URG+PSH).

- **Window Size:**  
  - Some OS detection relies on the default TCP window size returned by open ports.

- **Options:**  
  - Craft custom TCP packets using `--tcp-options` for advanced evasion or fingerprinting.

> Nmap takes full advantage of TCP header flexibility, using combinations of fields and flags to provide reliable, stealthy, and informative scanning capabilities across a wide range of network environments.

# **UDP Header Fields & Their Role in Nmap Scans**

> The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol at the transport layer, known for its speed and simplicity, but lacks reliability mechanisms found in TCP. This affects how Nmap conducts scans and the type of information it gathers.

## **UDP Header Fields and Their Functions**

| Field              | Size (Bits) | Description                                        | Nmap Relevance                                                                |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Source Port        | 16          | Port used by the sender’s machine                  | Can be set via `--source-port` to evade firewalls                             |
| Destination Port   | 16          | Target port on the receiver’s machine              | Set with `-p`; defines which service is being scanned                         |
| Length             | 16          | Total size of UDP header plus data                 | Used in fragmentation and evasion techniques                                  |
| Checksum           | 16          | Validates integrity of header and data             | May be set incorrectly for stealth/evasion                                    |


## **How Nmap Uses UDP Header Fields in Scans**

**Source Port:**
- You can specify the source port when scanning, which can help bypass firewall rules that allow traffic from "trusted" ports:
  ```
  nmap --source-port 53 -sU 192.168.1.1
  ```
  This simulates legitimate DNS traffic.

**Destination Port:**
- Nmap targets specific UDP ports or ranges using the `-p` option, such as:
  ```
  nmap -sU -p 53,161,500 target.com
  ```
  This is commonly used for scanning DNS (53), SNMP (161), or IKE (500).

**Length Field:**
- The total length of the header and payload, which is important when crafting fragmented packets. Fragmentation may assist in bypassing certain security products or network controls.

**Checksum:**
- Used for error checking, but Nmap might deliberately set incorrect values in rare evasion scenarios.

## **Notes on UDP Scanning in Nmap**

- UDP scanning (`-sU`) is typically slower and less reliable than TCP scanning.
- UDP is stateless; many services do not respond unless given the exact correct packet, and silent drops (no response) are common.
- Nmap may retransmit UDP probes and interpret ICMP error messages (like "Port Unreachable") to confirm closed ports.

## **Summary:**
Nmap manipulates UDP header fields—source port, destination port, length, and checksum—primarily for targeted scans, evasion tactics, and to adapt to stateless communication. This enables the discovery of UDP services and vulnerabilities, despite the protocol's inherent limitations and the scanning challenges it presents.

# **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Its Role in Nmap Scans**

> ICMP operates at the network (Layer 3) of the OSI model and is crucial for network diagnostics, error reporting, and control—not for data transfer. Nmap uses ICMP extensively to map networks and assess hosts and security devices.

| Rest of Header  | 32          | Varies; can include sequence numbers, identifiers, timestamps, etc.                       |


## **Common ICMP Message Types and Use Cases**

| Type | Code  | Message                        | Typical Use Case                                                |
|------|-------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | 0     | Echo Reply                    | Response to Echo Request (ping reply)                           |
| 3    | 0-15  | Destination Unreachable       | Reports unreachable target (port/host/network)                  |
| 4    | 0     | Source Quench (deprecated)    | Request to slow down transmission                               |
| 5    | 0-3   | Redirect                      | Suggests alternate route for packets                            |
| 8    | 0     | Echo Request                  | Tests connectivity (ping sweep)                                 |
| 11   | 0-1   | Time Exceeded                 | TTL expired in transit (used in traceroute)                     |
| 12   | 0-1   | Parameter Problem             | Indicates malformed IP header                                   |


## **How Nmap Uses ICMP**

- **Echo Request (8) / Echo Reply (0):**
  - Used in Nmap's ping sweeps (`-sn`), allowing rapid discovery of live hosts on a network.

- **Destination Unreachable (3):**
  - Interpreted by Nmap to help identify filtered or firewalled ports/services when scanning—if access to a port is blocked, a corresponding ICMP error may be generated.

- **Time Exceeded (11):**
  - Utilized in traceroute scans (`--traceroute`), helping to map the network path/hop sequence from scanner to target.

- **Other Codes/Types:**
  - Help Nmap detect network or host issues, recognize route changes, or spot filtering along the scan path.

## **Summary:**
ICMP gives Nmap the ability to perform effective network mapping, device discovery, and route analysis, making it an essential protocol for both administrators and security testers. Nmap leverages ICMP message types and header fields strategically to gather information and adapt to different network conditions and protections.
