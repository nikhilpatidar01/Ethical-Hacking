# nping
**nping** is a free, open-source network packet generation tool and advanced ping utility. Part of the **Nmap suite**, it allows users to craft and send customized network packets across multiple protocols such as *TCP*, *UDP*, *ICMP*, and *ARP*, with fine-grained control over packet headers and payloads. Beyond basic host availability checks, nping can be used for advanced network testing, such as stack stress testing, ARP poisoning, denial-of-service (DoS) simulations, route tracing, and response time measurement. It features an **Echo Mode**, which helps analyze packet transit—useful for troubleshooting firewalls, diagnosing network path issues, and detecting packet corruption. nping runs on **Linux, Windows, BSD, and macOS**, and is highly flexible for diverse network measurement and security auditing needs.

### Key Features
- Custom **TCP, UDP, ICMP, and ARP** packet generation.
- Support for multiple target hosts and ports.
- **Echo Mode** for packet transit analysis.
- Route tracing capabilities.
- Ethernet frame generation.
- Experimental **IPv6** support.
- Runs on multiple operating systems.

> **Note:** nping requires appropriate privileges for raw socket operations and should be used responsibly, as it can generate high network traffic.

**In summary:** nping extends the traditional ping utility with powerful packet crafting and analysis capabilities, making it ideal for network professionals and security experts.

### Command Examples

#### 1. Show help information
Prints detailed help about nping options and usage:

```bash
nping --help
```

#### 2. Basic ping to a host (ICMP by default)
Sends ICMP echo requests to dns.google and shows response times:

```bash
nping dns.google
```

#### 3. Send ARP request to a single IP on your local network
Checks if 192.168.129.60 responds to ARP (Layer 2 check):

```bash
nping --arp 192.168.129.60
```

#### 4. Send only one ARP request
`-c 1` sends exactly one packet:

```bash
nping --arp 192.168.129.60 -c 1
```

#### 5. ARP scan on a subnet
Sends one ARP request to each IP in 192.168.129.80/24:

```bash
nping --arp 192.168.129.80/24 -c 1
```

#### 6. ARP requests to a list of IPs
Comma-separated IPs: 192.168.129.31, .60, .200, .145

```bash
nping --arp 192.168.129.31,60,200,145 -c 1
```

#### 7. TCP packets to port 80 with TTL=2
For checking router/firewall response:

```bash
nping --tcp -p 80 --ttl 2 192.168.129.145
```

#### 8. ICMP "time exceeded" packets
Used for traceroute/diagnostics:

```bash
nping --icmp --icmp-type time-exceeded 192.168.129.10
```

#### 9. Test if TCP port 443 is open (SYN scan)
Checks if HTTPS port is listening:

```bash
nping --tcp -p 443 192.168.129.60
```

#### 10. Send TCP RST packet to port 443 with TTL=2
Resets TCP connection (useful for firewalls):

```bash
nping --tcp -p 443 --flags RST --ttl 2 192.168.129.60
```

#### 11. Start an Nping Echo Server with passphrase "public"
Useful for running echo tests from other nping clients:

```bash
nping --echo-server "public"
```

# nping UDP Mode Examples

Nping can generate UDP packets for network testing, discovery, and diagnostics. Here are practical UDP examples:

#### 1. Send a UDP packet to a host (default port 33434)
Sends a probe to 192.168.129.145:

```bash
nping --udp 192.168.129.145
```

#### 2. Specify UDP destination port
Target port 53 (DNS):

```bash
nping --udp -p 53 192.168.129.145
```

#### 3. Multiple/range of UDP ports
- Multiple:  
  ```bash
  nping --udp -p 53,161,12345,80 192.168.129.145
  ```
- Range:  
  ```bash
  nping --udp -p 1000-1010 192.168.129.145
  ```

#### 4. Spoof source port (requires privileges)
Set source port to 50505:

```bash
sudo nping --udp -g 50505 -p 53 192.168.129.145
```

#### 5. Send a set number of UDP packets
Sends 5 UDP packets:

```bash
nping --udp -p 53 -c 5 192.168.129.145
```

#### 6. UDP packet with ASCII custom data
Sends "HelloUDP" as payload:

```bash
nping --udp -p 1337 --data-string "HelloUDP" 192.168.129.60
```

#### 7. UDP packet with 100 bytes random data

```bash
nping --udp -p 53 --data-length 100 192.168.129.60
```

#### 8. UDP packet with invalid checksum (for testing)
Makes the packet non-RFC compliant:

```bash
sudo nping --udp --badsum -p 53 192.168.129.60
```

#### 9. Send 2 UDP packets with custom message to a server

```bash
nping --udp -p 1337 --data-string "CustomMessage" -c 2 192.168.129.60
```

### UDP Command Syntax Overview

- `--udp` : Use UDP protocol mode.
- `-p ` : Target port(s)—single, comma-separated, or range.
- `-g ` : Source port (may require root).
- `--data-string "DATA"` : Custom ASCII payload.
- `--data-length ` : Random byte payload of given length.
- `-c ` : Number of packets.
- `--badsum` : Use invalid UDP checksum.

For UDP-based device/service testing, combine these options as needed for your scenario. Run with elevated privileges if packet spoofing or special flags are required.
