# 🌐 Website Reconnaissance

**Website reconnaissance** is the process of gathering publicly available information about a website, its infrastructure, and its online presence. It is a common initial step in **penetration testing**, **ethical hacking**, **SEO**, **research**, and **competitive analysis**.

---

## 📘 What is Website Reconnaissance?

Website reconnaissance involves collecting detailed information about a target website or web application. The purpose is to understand its:

* Structure and architecture
* Underlying technologies
* Possible vulnerabilities or exposure points

---

## 🎯 Why Perform Website Reconnaissance?

* **Security Assessment**: Identify vulnerabilities and attack surfaces.
* **Competitive Analysis**: Understand a competitor’s tech stack and strategies.
* **SEO/Marketing Research**: Evaluate site structure, indexing, and backlinks.
* **Compliance Monitoring**: Detect leaked sensitive data and privacy issues.

---

## 🧰 Typical Activities

* **Gather Basic Details**: IP address, DNS records, WHOIS data, SSL certificates
* **Collect Metadata**: Titles, meta tags, CMS/frameworks, JS libraries
* **Identify Exposed Information**: Emails, usernames, hidden paths
* **Spidering and Crawling**: Link mapping and structure analysis
* **Historical Analysis**: View past versions using archive services

# 🕸️ 3. Spidering and Crawling — Create Sitemap

## 🕷️ What is Spidering?

**Spidering** is the process of using automated bots to systematically follow links across a website.

### 🔍 Used For:

* Discovering internal & external links
* Detecting hidden directories/pages
* Mapping the structure of the site

### Key Features of Spidering

### Purpose

* Gather comprehensive information about a website, including:

  * URLs
  * Query parameters
  * Resources such as images, scripts, or files

### Tools

* Commonly used spidering tools include:

  * **Burp Suite**
  * **OWASP ZAP**
  * **Arachni**

### Use Case

* Discover pages or endpoints that are not directly linked from the main site, such as:

  * Admin panels
  * Hidden forms
  * Backup or old files

---

### Spidering Process

1. **Starting Point**

   * Begin with a *seed URL* (usually the homepage or a known entry point).

2. **Traversal**

   * Follow all hyperlinks found on each page, including:

     * Internal links (same domain)
     * External links (if in scope)

3. **Data Logging**

   * Record all discovered:

     * URLs
     * Query parameters
     * Dynamic endpoints (e.g., URLs with parameters or REST API endpoints)

4. **Scope Control**

   * Define the scope to avoid crawling irrelevant or unwanted pages, for example:

     * Exclude third-party domains
     * Avoid non-targeted subdomains

---

### Common Challenges

* **Dynamic Content**

  * Websites heavily reliant on JavaScript may need specialized tools or headless browsers (like Puppeteer or Selenium) to render and crawl content.

* **Access Restrictions**

  * Some areas may be protected by:

    * Authentication (login required)
    * IP restrictions or firewall rules


---

## 🌀 What is Crawling?

**Crawling** is a more comprehensive process. It includes spidering but also analyzes content.

### 🔍 Used For:

* Downloading page data
* Extracting metadata (titles, headers, scripts)
* Identifying vulnerabilities or hidden assets

> ⚠️ **Note**: Spidering = link mapping; Crawling = link + content analysis


# Crawling

### Definition

Crawling is a broader, systematic process of browsing and indexing content either across the entire internet or within a specific website. In penetration testing, crawling helps identify publicly accessible resources to provide a comprehensive view of the attack surface.

---

### Key Features of Crawling

* **Purpose:**
  Build a detailed index of a website’s content for further analysis and testing.

* **Tools:**
  Common tools used for crawling include:

  * **Burp Suite’s crawler**
  * **OWASP ZAP**
  * Custom scripts (e.g., Python scripts using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`)

* **Use Case:**

  * Widely used in SEO and digital marketing for content indexing.
  * In security testing, it helps discover overlooked files, directories, and resources that might be vulnerable.

---

### Crawling Process

1. **Discovery:**
   Systematically fetch pages, parse their content, and extract all links.

2. **Depth and Breadth Configuration:**

   * **Depth:** How many levels of links to follow from the starting page (e.g., link from homepage → second-level pages → deeper levels).
   * **Breadth:** How many different paths or branches across the site to explore.

3. **Data Collection:**
   Identify and record accessible resources, including:

   * Static content (HTML pages, images, scripts)
   * Dynamic content (pages generated via server-side scripts or APIs)
