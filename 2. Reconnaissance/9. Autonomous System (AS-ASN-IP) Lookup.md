# 🛰️ Autonomous System (AS / ASN / IP) Lookup Guide

Autonomous Systems (AS) are large networks managed by a single organization, operating under a unified routing policy. They’re the invisible highways of the internet.

## 🚦 What You Can Look Up

| 🔍 Lookup Type      | 💡 What It Tells You                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **ASN (AS Number)** | Unique ID like `AS15169` assigned to each AS      |
| **AS Name / Org**   | The company or entity that owns that ASN          |
| **IP → ASN**        | Find which AS controls a given IP address         |
| **ASN → IP Ranges** | List of IP prefixes (CIDR blocks) owned by an ASN |

## 🧑‍💻 CLI-Based ASN/IP Lookup

### ✅ 1. Using `whois` (Linux built-in)

#### 🔹 Lookup by IP or ASN:

```bash
whois <IP or ASN>
```

#### 🔹 Example:

```bash
whois 8.8.8.8
whois AS15169
```

#### 📥 Sample Output:

```
OrgName:    Google LLC
ASNumber:   AS15169
NetRange:   8.8.8.0 - 8.8.8.255
```

---

### ✅ 2. Team Cymru IP → ASN (Script-Friendly + Bulk Support)

#### 🔹 Install `whois` (if not already installed):

```bash
sudo apt install whois
```

#### 🔹 Single IP lookup:

```bash
whois -h whois.cymru.com " -v 8.8.8.8"
```

#### 🔹 Bulk IP lookup:

```bash
whois -h whois.cymru.com " -v < your_ip_list.txt"
```

#### 📥 Sample Output:

```
AS      | IP        | BGP Prefix   | CC | Registry | Allocated  | AS Name
15169   | 8.8.8.8   | 8.8.8.0/24   | US | arin     | 1992-12-01 | GOOGLE - Google LLC, US
```

## ⚙️ Want Full Automation?

Need a Python or Bash script to:

* Lookup 1,000s of IPs automatically?
* Export as CSV/JSON?
* Identify all ASN ranges + org info?

I got you. Ping me. I’ll script it like a wizard. 🧙‍♂️💻

> 💡 **Cyber Tip:** Pair `whois` with `nmap`, `curl`, or `dig` for deep network intel in red teaming or recon.
