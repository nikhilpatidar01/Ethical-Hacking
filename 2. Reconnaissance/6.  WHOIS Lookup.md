## 🌐 WHOIS Lookup

**WHOIS Lookup** is a process used to retrieve information about who owns a domain name (like `example.com`).

---

### 📘 What is WHOIS Lookup?

* WHOIS is a **protocol and set of databases** that store domain registration information.
* A WHOIS lookup reveals:

  * Domain owner (if not protected by privacy).
  * Contact email and phone number.
  * Domain creation and expiration dates.
  * Registrar (where the domain is registered).
  * Name servers (DNS settings).
  * Domain status (e.g., `clientTransferProhibited`).
