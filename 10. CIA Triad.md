# CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a fundamental security model that guides policies for information security within organizations. It focuses on three key objectives:

---

## 1. Confidentiality

**Goal**: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Key Strategies**:

* Data encryption (e.g., AES, TLS)
* Access controls and authentication (e.g., passwords, biometrics, RBAC)
* Network segmentation
* Information classification

**Examples**:

* Encrypting sensitive customer data stored in databases
* Requiring multi-factor authentication for system access

---

## 2. Integrity

**Goal**: Ensure the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data over its lifecycle.

**Key Strategies**:

* Hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256) to verify data integrity
* Digital signatures
* Version control and audit trails
* Secure data input validation

**Examples**:

* Using checksums to detect file corruption
* Applying digital signatures to verify the authenticity of documents

---

## 3. Availability

**Goal**: Ensure that authorized users can reliably access data and systems when needed.

**Key Strategies**:

* Redundant systems and failover solutions
* Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) protection
* Regular data backups
* System and network monitoring

**Examples**:

* Hosting critical services on cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling
* Performing regular backups and disaster recovery testing

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

**CVSS** is a standardized framework for rating the severity of software vulnerabilities. It helps organizations prioritize remediation efforts based on potential impact.

**Key Components**:

* **Base Score**: Intrinsic characteristics of the vulnerability (e.g., exploitability, impact)
* **Temporal Score**: Factors that change over time (e.g., availability of exploit code)
* **Environmental Score**: Adjustments based on a specific environment or configuration

**Resources**:

* [CVSS Overview (NIST NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
* [CVSS v3.1 Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1)
* [CVSS v4 Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0)
