# Go (Golang) Installation Guide for Linux

This guide covers:

* Installing a specific version of **Go (Golang)**
* Configuring your environment
* Installing Go-based tools for **Offensive Security**

---

## 1. Check Existing Go Installation

Before proceeding, check if Go is already installed:

```bash
go version
```

* If Go is installed, it will return the version (e.g., `go version go1.20.4 linux/amd64`)
* If not, you'll get an error

---

## 2. Download Go

### Official Download Page:

[https://go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl)

### Direct Download (example for Go 1.24.5):

```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

> *Update the version URL based on your preferred Go release.*

---

## 3. Remove Existing Go Installation

To avoid version conflicts:

```bash
sudo apt remove golang-go
```

---

## 4. Remove Old Go Directory (if exists)

Check if the Go directory is present:

```bash
ls /usr/local/go
```

If it exists, remove it and extract the new tarball:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.24.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Verify:

```bash
ls /usr/local/go
```

---

## 5. Confirm Go Installation

Check the new installation:

```bash
/usr/local/go/bin/go version
```

---

## 6. Set Environment Variables

Set up the required environment variables in your shell config file.

### Detect your shell:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

### Then add the following to your shell configuration file:

#### For Zsh (`~/.zshrc`):

```bash
echo "export GOROOT=/usr/local/go" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "export GOPATH=\$HOME/go" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:\$GOROOT/bin:\$GOPATH/bin" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### For Bash (`~/.bashrc`):

```bash
echo "export GOROOT=/usr/local/go" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export GOPATH=\$HOME/go" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:\$GOROOT/bin:\$GOPATH/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## 7. Verify Go Installation

```bash
go version
```

You should see the version you installed (e.g., `go version go1.24.5 linux/amd64`)

# Installing Go Tools for Offensive Security

You can install popular Go-based pentesting tools using a script provided by InfoSecWarrior.

---

## 1. Become Root

```bash
sudo su -
```

---

## 2. Download the Installation Script

Navigate to `/opt`:

```bash
cd /opt
```

Download the script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfoSecWarrior/Offensive-Pentesting-Scripts/main/Gotools-Install/gotools-install.sh
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x gotools-install.sh
```

---

## 3. Run the Script

```bash
./gotools-install.sh
```

This script will install commonly used Go-based security tools, such as:

* httpx
* subfinder
* naabu
* amass
* dnsx
* and more...

---

## Final Check

```bash
which go
go version
which httpx
```
