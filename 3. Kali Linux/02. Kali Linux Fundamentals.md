# 🐉 Kali Linux Fundamentals

A complete beginner-to-pro overview of **Kali Linux** — from its roots to real-world usage.

---

## 📜 What is Kali Linux?

Kali Linux is a **Debian-based distribution** maintained by [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/), designed specifically for:

* 🛠️ Penetration Testing
* 🕵️ Ethical Hacking
* 🧪 Digital Forensics
* 🔍 Security Research

Kali comes **pre-installed** with hundreds of tools for reconnaissance, exploitation, forensics, wireless attacks, post-exploitation, and more.

## 🧬 BackTrack Linux: The Origin (2006–2013)

Before Kali, there was **BackTrack Linux**, a legendary pentesting distro created by merging:

* **WHAX (Whoppix)** – Wireless auditing distro
* **Auditor Security Collection** – A security toolkit with a GUI

### 🔧 BackTrack v1 (2006)

* Combined WHAX and Auditor tools
* Bootable Live CD
* Focused on wireless hacking, scanning, and exploitation
* Tools like: **Aircrack-ng**, **Kismet**, **Nmap**, **Metasploit**

### ⚠️ Limitations:

* No package management system
* Minimal persistence and customization
* Non-compliant with Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

## 🎉 Birth of Kali Linux (2013)

In **March 2013**, **Kali Linux** was born as the spiritual successor of BackTrack Linux.

### 🚨 Why the Change?

* BackTrack lacked proper package management
* Script maintenance was messy
* Needed FHS-compliance and modularity
* Developers wanted a cleaner, more modern base

---

## 💡 Key Improvements in Kali

* ✅ Based on **Debian**
* ✅ Uses **APT** package manager
* ✅ Fully **FHS-compliant**
* ✅ ISO customization via **live-build**
* ✅ Rolling release model
* ✅ Initially ran as **root by default**
