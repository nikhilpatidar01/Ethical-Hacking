# 🐍 Python Installation and Environment Setup

This guide walks you through:

* Installing **Python 2.7** and **Python 3.x**
* Setting up **pip** for both versions
* Installing **BeautifulSoup4**
* Creating an isolated Python environment using **`venv`**

---

## ✅ Checking Existing Python & Pip Versions

Check if Python and pip are already installed:

```php
python -V
```
```php
python2.7 -V
```
```php
pip -V
```
```php
pip2.7 -V
```

---

## 🌿 Installing BeautifulSoup4

Install BeautifulSoup4 for both Python versions:

```php
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
```php
pip2.7 install beautifulsoup4
```

---

## 📦 Installing pip for Python 2.7

If `pip2.7` is not available:

1. Download the installer:

   ```php
   wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py -O get-pip.py
   ```

2. Run the installer:

   ```php
   python2.7 get-pip.py
   ```

3. Verify pip:

   ```php
   pip2.7 -V
   ```

4. Test installation with:

   ```php
   pip2.7 install beautifulsoup4
   ```

## 🐍 Installing pip for Default Python (Python 3.x)

If pip is not available for Python 3:

```php
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/get-pip.py -O get-pip.py
```
```php
python get-pip.py
```

---

## 🧱 Installing Python 3 Full Package and venv

Install full Python support with virtual environment tools:

```php
apt install python3.13-venv
```
```php
apt install python3-full python-is-python3
```

---

## 🏗️ Creating a Virtual Environment

1. Make a directory for the environment:

   ```php
   mkdir /opt/python-environment
   ```

2. Create the virtual environment:

   ```php
   python3 -m venv /opt/python-environment
   ```

---

## 📥 Installing pip in the Virtual Environment

If pip is missing in the virtual environment:

1. Download get-pip:

   ```php
   wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/get-pip.py -O get-pip.py
   ```

2. Run the installer using the virtual environment’s Python:

   ```php
   /opt/python-environment/bin/python get-pip.py
   ```

3. Check pip version:

   ```php
   /opt/python-environment/bin/pip -V
   ```

---

## 🔄 Setting System-wide pip to Virtual Environment

1. Check existing pip path:

   ```php
   which pip
   ```

2. Remove current symlink if needed:

   ```php
   ls -lh /usr/local/bin/pip
   ```
   ```php
   rm -f /usr/local/bin/pip
   ```

3. Create a new symlink:

   ```php
   ln -s /opt/python-environment/bin/pip /usr/local/bin/pip
   ```

4. Confirm:

   ```php
   pip -V
   ```

5. Install globally using this pip:

   ```php
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```

## 🔎 Version Check Summary

```php
pip -V
# Output:
# pip 25.1.1 from /opt/python-environment/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pip (python 3.13)

pip2.7 -V
# pip 20.3.4 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip (python 2.7)

python -V
# Python 3.13.5

python2.7 -V
# Python 2.7.18
```

---

## 🧬 Making the Virtual Environment Globally Accessible

Add virtual environment path to your shell config:

### For Zsh users:

```php
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/opt/python-environment/bin" >> ~/.zshrc
```
```php
source ~/.zshrc
```

### For Bash users:

```php
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/opt/python-environment/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
```
```php
source ~/.bashrc
```
