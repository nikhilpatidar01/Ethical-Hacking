# 🛡️ Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)

**Penetration Testing** is a simulated cyberattack against a system, application, or network to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities—just like a real attacker would. The goal is to find and fix weaknesses before malicious hackers can exploit them.

## ❓ What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration Testing is the practice of evaluating the security of an IT environment by simulating real-world attacks. It is an **authorized and controlled process** carried out by ethical hackers (penetration testers) to:

* 🔍 Identify security flaws
* ✅ Validate the effectiveness of defenses
* ⚠️ Understand the potential impact of various attack types
* 🛠️ Provide recommendations to mitigate risks

---

## 🔑 Why is Penetration Testing Important?

* Finds vulnerabilities **proactively** before attackers do
* Helps meet **compliance requirements** (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA)
* Validates **security controls** and **patch management**
* Assesses **incident detection** and **response capabilities**
* Enhances **security awareness and training**

## ⚙️ What Does Penetration Testing Involve?

A typical penetration test includes the following phases:

1. **Planning & Scoping** – Define objectives, rules of engagement, and scope.
2. **Reconnaissance** – Gather intelligence (both passive and active).
3. **Scanning** – Identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Exploitation** – Attempt to exploit discovered vulnerabilities.
5. **Post-Exploitation** – Assess impact, escalate privileges, pivot within the network.
6. **Reporting** – Document findings, assess risk, and recommend mitigation steps.

## 🧪 Types of Penetration Testing

| **Type**                     | **Focus Area**                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network**                  | Internal and external network infrastructure (routers, firewalls, switches)      |
| **Web Application**          | Web applications and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi, CSRF)        |
| **API**                      | RESTful and SOAP API security, including authentication and data handling        |
| **Mobile Application**       | iOS and Android app security (local storage, API calls, permissions)             |
| **Desktop Applications**     | Security of software installed on endpoint systems                               |
| **Wireless**                 | Wi-Fi networks, encryption protocols, rogue access point detection               |
| **IoT (Internet of Things)** | Security of smart/embedded devices and their ecosystems                          |
| **Red Teaming**              | Real-world attack simulation across multiple vectors (physical, digital, social) |
| **Cloud**                    | Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP), misconfigurations, IAM roles             |
| **Social Engineering**       | Phishing, pretexting, baiting, impersonation tactics                             |
| **Physical Security**        | Physical access to systems, hardware, buildings, and restricted areas            |

## 🔍 Pen Testing Methodologies

* **Black Box** – No internal knowledge; simulates an external attacker.
* **Gray Box** – Partial knowledge (e.g., credentials); simulates a semi-insider.
* **White Box** – Full internal knowledge; used for thorough and deep analysis.
