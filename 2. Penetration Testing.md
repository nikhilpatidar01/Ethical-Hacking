# 🛡️ Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)

**Penetration Testing** is a simulated cyberattack against a system, application, or network to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities—just like a real attacker would. The goal is to find and fix weaknesses before malicious hackers can exploit them.

## ❓ What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration Testing is the practice of evaluating the security of an IT environment by simulating real-world attacks. It is an **authorized and controlled process** carried out by ethical hackers (penetration testers) to:

* 🔍 Identify security flaws
* ✅ Validate the effectiveness of defenses
* ⚠️ Understand the potential impact of various attack types
* 🛠️ Provide recommendations to mitigate risks

---

## 🔑 Why is Penetration Testing Important?

* Finds vulnerabilities **proactively** before attackers do
* Helps meet **compliance requirements** (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA)
* Validates **security controls** and **patch management**
* Assesses **incident detection** and **response capabilities**
* Enhances **security awareness and training**

## ⚙️ What Does Penetration Testing Involve?

A typical penetration test includes the following phases:

1. **Planning & Scoping** – Define objectives, rules of engagement, and scope.
2. **Reconnaissance** – Gather intelligence (both passive and active).
3. **Scanning** – Identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Exploitation** – Attempt to exploit discovered vulnerabilities.
5. **Post-Exploitation** – Assess impact, escalate privileges, pivot within the network.
6. **Reporting** – Document findings, assess risk, and recommend mitigation steps.

## 🧪 Types of Penetration Testing

| Type                     | Focus Area                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network**              | Internal & external network infrastructure         |
| **Web Application**      | Web apps and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities          |
| **API**                  | Security of REST/SOAP APIs                         |
| **Mobile Application**   | iOS and Android mobile apps                        |
| **Cloud**                | Cloud services & configurations (AWS, Azure, GCP)  |
| **Social Engineering**   | Phishing, impersonation, and human-based attacks   |
| **Physical Security**    | Access to buildings, devices, and hardware         |
| **Wireless**             | Wi-Fi encryption and rogue device detection        |
| **IoT**                  | Security of smart devices and connected ecosystems |
| **Desktop Applications** | Local software on endpoints                        |
| **Red Teaming**          | Full-scale, real-world attack simulation           |

## 🔍 Pen Testing Methodologies

* **Black Box** – No internal knowledge; simulates an external attacker.
* **Gray Box** – Partial knowledge (e.g., credentials); simulates a semi-insider.
* **White Box** – Full internal knowledge; used for thorough and deep analysis.
