# üõ°Ô∏è Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)

**Penetration Testing** is a simulated cyberattack against a system, application, or network to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities‚Äîjust like a real attacker would. The goal is to find and fix weaknesses before malicious hackers can exploit them.

---

## ‚ùì What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration Testing is the practice of evaluating the security of an IT environment by simulating real-world attacks. It is an **authorized and controlled process** carried out by ethical hackers (penetration testers) to:

* üîç Identify security flaws
* ‚úÖ Validate the effectiveness of defenses
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Understand the potential impact of various attack types
* üõ†Ô∏è Provide recommendations to mitigate risks

---

## üîë Why is Penetration Testing Important?

* Finds vulnerabilities **proactively** before attackers do
* Helps meet **compliance requirements** (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA)
* Validates **security controls** and **patch management**
* Assesses **incident detection** and **response capabilities**
* Enhances **security awareness and training**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Does Penetration Testing Involve?

A typical penetration test includes the following phases:

1. **Planning & Scoping** ‚Äì Define objectives, rules of engagement, and scope.
2. **Reconnaissance** ‚Äì Gather intelligence (both passive and active).
3. **Scanning** ‚Äì Identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Exploitation** ‚Äì Attempt to exploit discovered vulnerabilities.
5. **Post-Exploitation** ‚Äì Assess impact, escalate privileges, pivot within the network.
6. **Reporting** ‚Äì Document findings, assess risk, and recommend mitigation steps.

## üß™ Types of Penetration Testing

| **Type**                     | **Focus Area**                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network**                  | Internal and external network infrastructure (routers, firewalls, switches)      |
| **Web Application**          | Web applications and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQLi, CSRF)        |
| **API**                      | RESTful and SOAP API security, including authentication and data handling        |
| **Mobile Application**       | iOS and Android app security (local storage, API calls, permissions)             |
| **Desktop Applications**     | Security of software installed on endpoint systems                               |
| **Wireless**                 | Wi-Fi networks, encryption protocols, rogue access point detection               |
| **IoT (Internet of Things)** | Security of smart/embedded devices and their ecosystems                          |
| **Red Teaming**              | Real-world attack simulation across multiple vectors (physical, digital, social) |
| **Cloud**                    | Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP), misconfigurations, IAM roles             |
| **Social Engineering**       | Phishing, pretexting, baiting, impersonation tactics                             |
| **Physical Security**        | Physical access to systems, hardware, buildings, and restricted areas            |

## üîç Pen Testing Methodologies

* **Black Box** ‚Äì No internal knowledge; simulates an external attacker.
* **Gray Box** ‚Äì Partial knowledge (e.g., credentials); simulates a semi-insider.
* **White Box** ‚Äì Full internal knowledge; used for thorough and deep analysis.

## üîç Types of Penetration Testing ‚Äì Detailed in Sequence

---

### 1. **Network Penetration Testing**

Focuses on internal and external network infrastructure.

* **Internal Network Testing**
  Simulates insider threats or compromised internal devices to assess risks within the organization's trusted zone.
* **External Network Testing**
  Tests the security of internet-facing systems like firewalls, routers, and servers.
* **Network + PCI Segmentation Testing**
  Ensures segmentation complies with PCI DSS to protect cardholder data.

---

### 2. **Web Application Penetration Testing**

Targets web apps for vulnerabilities typically listed in the OWASP Top 10:

* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Insecure Deserialization
* May also include **Web + API testing** to verify backend integration security.

---

### 3. **API Penetration Testing**

Focuses on REST/SOAP APIs for:

* Broken authentication
* Input validation failures
* Rate limiting issues
* Data leakage risks

---

### 4. **Mobile Application Penetration Testing**

Targets iOS and Android mobile apps.

* Looks for:

  * Insecure data storage
  * Weak session management
  * Poor encryption
* Often includes **Mobile + API** testing.

---

### 5. **Desktop Application Penetration Testing**

Tests local software installed on user endpoints.

* Assesses:

  * Buffer overflows
  * Privilege escalation
  * Insecure local file storage or weak permissions

---

### 6. **Wireless Network Penetration Testing**

Focuses on Wi-Fi infrastructure:

* Tests for:

  * Weak encryption (e.g., WEP/WPA flaws)
  * Rogue access points
  * Inadequate network segmentation

---

### 7. **IoT Penetration Testing**

Targets smart and connected devices.

* Evaluates:

  * Default credentials
  * Lack of firmware updates
  * Insecure communication protocols

---

### 8. **Red Teaming**

A full-scope simulated attack replicating an **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**.

* Combines:

  * Social engineering
  * Technical exploitation
  * Physical intrusion
* Tests detection and response capabilities of blue teams.

---

### 9. **Cloud Penetration Testing**

Focuses on cloud environments like AWS, Azure, GCP.

* Identifies:

  * Misconfigured services
  * Poor IAM policies
  * Publicly exposed assets
* Includes **Cloud Configuration Testing** like firewall rules, S3 permissions.

---

### 10. **Social Engineering & Phishing Testing**

Simulates human-targeted attacks:

* Email phishing
* Vishing (voice calls)
* Pretexting (impersonation)
  Assesses employee awareness and training effectiveness.

---

### 11. Threat Modeling & Security Hardening
* Threat Modeling:** Identifies potential attack vectors early in the design process.
* Security Hardening:** Configures systems to reduce attack surfaces and eliminate unnecessary services.

---


### 12. **Physical Penetration Testing**

Tests the physical security of premises and hardware:

* Unauthorized facility access
* Badge cloning
* Tailgating
  Evaluates real-world access controls.
