# Reconnaissance (Footprinting)

**Reconnaissance** is the initial phase of a penetration test or cyberattack, where the attacker gathers as much information as possible about the target system or organization. This phase is crucial as it helps plan the subsequent stages of an attack or test.

---

## Types of Reconnaissance

### 1. Passive Reconnaissance

Collecting information without directly interacting with the target.

**Examples:**

* Searching public records
* Examining social media
* Using tools like `WHOIS`, DNS queries, or public websites (e.g., job boards, company websites)

### 2. Active Reconnaissance

Involves direct interaction with the target to gather information.

**Examples:**

* Scanning ports and services using tools like `Nmap`
* Sending phishing emails to gather credentials
* Probing web applications for vulnerabilities

---

## Goals of Reconnaissance

* Identify potential entry points
* Understand the target's network structure
* Collect details about users, roles, and infrastructure
* Determine possible vulnerabilities

---

## Key Areas of Focus

### 1. Network Vulnerabilities

* **Open Ports**: Unnecessary or unsecured ports exposing services
* **Misconfigured Devices**: Routers, firewalls, and switches with weak/default configurations
* **Weak Network Protocols**: Use of outdated protocols (e.g., Telnet, FTP, SMBv1)
* **Unauthorized Access**: Systems that allow connections without proper authentication

### 2. Web Application Vulnerabilities

Common issues (**OWASP Top 10**):

* **Injection Attacks**: SQL, NoSQL, Command, and LDAP injection
* **Broken Authentication**: Weak or missing authentication mechanisms
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Malicious scripts in web pages
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Forcing users to perform actions unknowingly
* **Insecure Deserialization**: Exploiting serialized data to execute arbitrary code

### 3. System and Server Vulnerabilities

* **Unpatched Software**: Missing security updates
* **Default Credentials**: Factory-set usernames and passwords
* **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher privileges via misconfigurations or vulnerabilities
* **Insecure File Permissions**: Sensitive files accessible to unauthorized users

### 4. Authentication and Authorization Issues

* **Weak Password Policies**: Easily guessable or reused passwords
* **Brute Force and Dictionary Attacks**: Attempting to crack credentials
* **Misconfigured MFA**: Weak or missing multi-factor authentication

### 5. Data Exposure

* **Sensitive Information in Code/Logs**: Credentials, API keys, or PII in source code, error messages, or logs
* **Data Leaks**: Exposed databases, cloud storage, or backups
* **Improper Data Encryption**: Use of outdated or weak encryption

### 6. Social Engineering Weaknesses

* **Phishing Susceptibility**: Employees falling for fake emails or websites
* **Pretexting**: Impersonation to gain sensitive information
* **Physical Security Gaps**: Unsecured physical access to systems or sensitive areas

### 7. Wireless Network Vulnerabilities

* **Insecure Wi-Fi Configurations**: Open or weakly encrypted wireless networks
* **Rogue Access Points**: Unauthorized devices mimicking legitimate networks
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Intercepting communication between devices

### 8. Cloud Security Issues

* **Misconfigured Storage Buckets**: Publicly accessible (e.g., S3 buckets)
* **Exposed APIs**: APIs lacking authentication or rate-limiting
* **IAM Misconfigurations**: Overly permissive roles or exposed credentials

### 9. IoT and Embedded System Weaknesses

* **Hardcoded Credentials**: Fixed credentials in devices
* **Insecure Firmware**: Firmware vulnerabilities
* **Lack of Updates**: Devices not receiving regular security patches

## Organization Information

* **Organization Website**: Public-facing resource with general/technical info
* **Company Directory**: Lists employees, roles, and contact details
* **Employee Details**: Profiles from LinkedIn, social media, or public platforms
* **Location Details**: Physical addresses and office locations
* **Phone Numbers/Addresses**: Valuable for pretexting or phone-based phishing
* **Comments in HTML Source Code**: Developer notes or references

  * Example: `<!-- TODO: Remove this link before going live -->`
* **Security Policies Deployed**: Public policies or notices showing security posture
* **Web Server Links**: External APIs or third-party services linked to the website
* **Background of Organization**: Companyâ€™s history and structure
* **News/Press Releases**: Recent changes, expansions, or acquisitions

---

## Network Information

* **Domain Names**: Identifies organization's internet presence

  * Example: `example.com`, `sub.example.com`
* **Internal Domains**: Insights into internal naming conventions

  * Example: `internal.local`, `intranet.example.com`
* **IP Addresses**: Public and private IP ranges
* **Unmonitored/Private Websites**: Internal applications not publicly indexed
* **TCP/UDP Services**: Services running on specific ports

  * Example: HTTP (80), SSH (22)
* **VPN/IDS/IPS/Access Controls**: Secure access and network protection mechanisms
* **Phone Numbers/VoIP**: Communication systems for potential social engineering

---

## Operating System Information

* **User & Group Info**: Usernames and group memberships
* **Banner Grabbing**: Captures banners to identify software/versions
* **Routing Tables**: Network routes and interfaces
* **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**: Device and network details
* **System Architecture**: 32-bit, 64-bit, or other platform details
* **Remote Systems**: Connected or shared systems
* **System Names**: Naming conventions indicating roles

  * Example: `DC01` (Domain Controller), `SQLServer`
* **Passwords**: Credentials from exposed services, brute-force, or social engineering

## External Reconnaissance

* **Network**: Public-facing IPs and domains
* **Phone**: Public or leaked phone numbers
* **Website**: Analyze forms, scripts, and structure
* **Source Code**: Public repositories (e.g., GitHub)
* **Website Mirroring**: Tools like `wget`, `HTTrack`
* **Archive Sites**: Historical snapshots (e.g., Archive.org)
* **GitHub Recon**: Tools like `Gitrob`, `truffleHog`

## Attack Surface Mapping

**Attack surface mapping** is the process of identifying and analyzing all possible points of interaction with a target system or organization. It helps in understanding the scope of potential vulnerabilities.

### Key Components

#### 1. External Attack Surface

* Public-facing applications (web apps, APIs, VPNs)
* Public IP addresses
* DNS records
* Cloud services
* Third-party services

#### 2. Internal Attack Surface

* Internal web apps (e.g., intranet, admin portals)
* Internal networks and shared drives
* User accounts and privilege levels
* Internal services (databases, file servers)

#### 3. Physical Attack Surface

* Office buildings and access points
* Employee devices (laptops, USBs)
* IoT devices (cameras, sensors)
* Dumpster diving risks

### Process

1. **Discovery**: Identify all assets
2. **Enumeration**: Gather detailed info (versions, configs)
3. **Classification**: Determine asset sensitivity
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate vulnerabilities and impact
5. **Visualization**: Diagrams or tables to represent attack surface
6. **Prioritization**: Focus on most critical assets
