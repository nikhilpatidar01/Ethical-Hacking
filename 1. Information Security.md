# 📚 Information Security (InfoSec)


## 🔐 What is Information Security?

**Information Security (InfoSec)** is the practice of **protecting information in all its forms** (digital, physical, verbal, etc.) from:

* Unauthorized access
* Disruption
* Modification
* Inspection
* Recording
* Destruction

The goal is to **safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of data.

## 🎯 Key Objectives of Information Security – The CIA Triad

The foundation of Information Security is based on the **CIA Triad**:

### 1. 🔒 Confidentiality

Ensures that **only authorized individuals** have access to the information.

* **Purpose**: Prevent unauthorized disclosure.
* **Examples**:

  * Encryption
  * Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  * Access control lists (ACLs)

---

### 2. ✅ Integrity

Ensures that **data remains accurate and unaltered**, except by authorized sources.

* **Purpose**: Maintain trust in data.
* **Examples**:

  * Hashing (e.g., SHA-256)
  * Checksums
  * Digital signatures

---

### 3. 🟢 Availability

Ensures that **authorized users have access** to information and systems when needed.

* **Purpose**: Prevent downtime and ensure continuity.
* **Examples**:

  * Backup systems
  * Redundancy
  * Failover mechanisms

---

# 🛡️ Cyber Security 

## 🔐 What is Cybersecurity?

**Cybersecurity** is the **practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs** from:

* Digital attacks
* Unauthorized access
* Damage or disruption

The goal is to defend digital infrastructure and secure data against various cyber threats.

---

## 👾 Hacking

**Hacking** refers to:

> The act of exploring security breaches and exploiting a system's vulnerabilities or weaknesses to gain **unauthorized access** to system resources and features—often beyond the original intent of the system’s creators.

---

## 🤝 Ethical Hacking (White-Hat Hacking)

**Ethical Hacking** is the **legal use of hacking techniques** to:

* Test systems for vulnerabilities
* Identify weaknesses
* Improve overall security

✅ Also known as **White-Hat Hacking**
✅ Performed **with permission** from system owners

---

## ⚔️ Hacking vs Ethical Hacking

| **Feature**    | **Hacking**                                                   | **Ethical Hacking**                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**    | To exploit vulnerabilities for **personal or malicious gain** | To identify and fix vulnerabilities to **improve security** |
| **Legality**   | Illegal                                                       | Legal (performed with **explicit permission**)              |
| **Intent**     | Harmful – data theft, disruption, damage                      | Helpful – protection, prevention, risk mitigation           |
