---

## 💡 **Examples of Payloads in Action**

### • 🧬 SQL Injection Attack

The **payload** is a malicious SQL query, like one that creates an **admin user** in the database, giving full access.

### • 📧 Phishing Email

The **payload** might be a **malicious executable** or **script** attached in the email.
Once opened, it installs **malware** on the victim’s machine.

---

## 🛡️ **Mitigation Against Malicious Payloads**

### 🛑 Antivirus & Anti-Malware

Scan and block known malicious payloads in real-time.

### 🔄 Regular Patching

Fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited to deliver a payload.
