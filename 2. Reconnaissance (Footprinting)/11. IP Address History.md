# 📜 IP Address History

## 🔎 What is IP Address History?

**IP Address History** refers to the record of all IP addresses (A records) that a domain has pointed to over time. These changes are captured and archived by passive DNS services or DNS history tracking tools.

## 🔧 Common Tool: ViewDNS IP History

**Website:** [https://viewdns.info/iphistory](https://viewdns.info/iphistory)

### 🧪 Lookup Example:

**Domain:** `armourinfosec.com`
**IP Address History:**

| IP Address    | First Seen | Last Seen  |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 103.21.59.29  | 2023-05-12 | 2024-11-20 |
| 162.21.123.20 | 2022-01-05 | 2023-05-11 |
| 192.185.129.4 | 2020-08-18 | 2022-01-04 |

> 📅 *"First Seen" and "Last Seen" indicate when ViewDNS observed the domain resolving to that IP.*

## 🧠 Use Cases

* ✅ **Investigate Past Hosting Providers** – See where and with whom the domain was hosted.
* 🛡️ **Detect Domain Hijacking or DNS Tampering** – Changes in IP may indicate malicious activity.
* 🔍 **Attribution in Threat Intelligence** – Track historical infrastructure usage.
* 🕵️ **Reconnaissance in OSINT & Pentesting** – Enumerate infrastructure during security assessments.
