## 🔍 What is Email Tracking?

**Email Tracking** is the process of monitoring and analyzing email communication to extract critical metadata, such as:

* 📍 **Sender’s IP address**
* 🌐 **Geographic location** of the sender
* 📡 **Email service provider** used
* 🕒 **Time and date** of sending
* 📨 **Mail server hops** (via email headers)

📌 It is particularly useful in:

* Cyber forensics
* Incident response
* Phishing or spam investigations

---

## ⚙️ How Email Tracking Works

When an email is sent, each mail server it passes through adds a `Received:` header to the email metadata.

By examining these headers, investigators can:

* ✅ Trace the **origin IP address**
* 🧭 View **timestamp logs** of mail hops
* 🚨 Detect **header forgery** or **spoofing**

---

### 🧪 Example Email Header (Simplified)

```text
Received: from unknown (HELO mail.example.com) (192.168.1.10)
by mail.yourdomain.com with SMTP; Thu, 1 Jul 2025 +0530
```

#### Breakdown:

* `192.168.1.10` – Sender’s IP (could be masked or internal)
* `mail.example.com` – Sender’s mail server
* `Thu, 1 Jul 2025` – Time of receipt

---

## 🛠️ Use Cases of Email Tracking

* 🔐 Identifying the origin of **phishing or spam emails**
* 🕵️‍♂️ Investigating **email-related cybercrimes**
* 🧪 Verifying if an email came from a **spoofed domain**
* 🧨 Tracing **insider threats** or **leaked communications**

## 🧾 How to View Email Headers (with Download Method – Offline)

### ✅ Step-by-Step (Gmail)

1. Open the email.
2. Click the **3-dot menu (⋮)** near the reply button.
3. Select **"Download message"** — this saves a file with `.eml` extension.
4. Locate the `.eml` file in your **Downloads** folder.
5. **Right-click → Open with → Notepad** (or any text editor).

---

### 📂 Structure of the `.eml` or Raw Email File

When you open the downloaded file:

* Everything **above the first empty line** is the **email header**.
* Everything **after the empty line** is the **email body** (actual content).

Example:

```text
Received: from sender.domain.com (123.45.67.89)
Date: Tue, 2 Jul 2025 10:20:00 +0000
From: attacker@example.com
To: victim@example.com
Subject: Urgent Invoice

Hello, please check the attached invoice...
```

🔍 In this case:

* Header ends before the **empty line**
* Body starts **after the empty line**

---

### 🖥️ Outlook (Desktop App)

1. Double-click the email to open.
2. Go to **File → Save As** → Save as `.eml` or `.msg`.
3. Open in **Notepad** or **Outlook Viewer Tool**.
4. Analyze the header manually using built-in tools or offline scripts.

### 🛑 No Online Tool Needed

This method is useful in **offline forensics**, air-gapped analysis, or where **privacy/legal** policies prevent you from uploading headers to online tools.
