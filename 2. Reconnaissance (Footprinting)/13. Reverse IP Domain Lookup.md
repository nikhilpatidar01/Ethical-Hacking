# 🌐 Reverse IP Domain Lookup

## 🧠 What is It?

**Reverse IP Lookup** identifies **all domains hosted on a single IP address**. This technique is super helpful in:

* 🔎 **OSINT investigations**
* 🛠️ **Penetration testing**
* 🧱 **Infrastructure mapping**

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

* 🕵️ **Discover domains** sharing the same server
* 🔧 Identify **shared hosting** or misconfigured **virtual hosts**
* 🧪 Uncover **dev**, **staging**, or **internal sites**
* 🔁 Pivot to **related assets** during recon or bug bounty hunts

## ⚠️ Notes

* 🧾 Shared hosting = **hundreds of domains per IP**
* 🔒 Dedicated IP = **usually 1 domain**
* ☁️ Cloud/CDN (e.g., **Cloudflare**) = unrelated domains due to edge IP usage

---

## 🔐 Defensive Tips (Blue Team)

* 🎯 Use **dedicated IP addresses** for sensitive assets
* 🧱 Properly configure **virtual hosts**
* 🛡️ Consider **WAF/CDN providers** (like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) to hide real IPs
