# Bug Bounty

A **Bug Bounty** is a program where companies reward individuals for finding and responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities in their software or systems.

---

## How It Works

1. A company defines the scope and rules of its bug bounty program.
2. Security researchers test the software or systems within the scope.
3. Vulnerabilities are submitted through a platform or direct channel.
4. The company verifies the reported issue.
5. A reward (bounty) is paid based on the severity of the vulnerability.

## Bug Bounty Severity Classification

In bug bounty programs, vulnerabilities are commonly categorized into five severity levels: **P1 to P5**. These help determine how urgent and impactful a reported vulnerability is.

| Severity               | Description                                                    | Impact                                                            | Response                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **P1 — Critical**      | Easily exploitable vulnerabilities with severe consequences.   | Complete system compromise, data loss, or critical business risk. | Requires immediate action.      |
| **P2 — High**          | Vulnerabilities that can cause major damage.                   | Unauthorized access, service disruption, or major data exposure.  | High priority fix.              |
| **P3 — Medium**        | Moderately impactful and exploitable vulnerabilities.          | Limited data disclosure or access control issues.                 | Fix in the regular patch cycle. |
| **P4 — Low**           | Low-risk issues that require specific conditions.              | Minor leaks or usability concerns.                                | Fix when feasible.              |
| **P5 — Informational** | No real security impact; may be non-exploitable or duplicates. | None or purely theoretical.                                       | Often no fix required.          |
