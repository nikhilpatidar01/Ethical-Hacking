Penetration testing can be conducted using various approaches depending on the depth of access and visibility granted to the tester. Each methodology serves a specific purpose in evaluating different threat perspectives.

### 🕵️ **Black Box Testing**

* **Description:**
  The tester has no prior knowledge of the internal systems, architecture, or credentials.

* **Use Case:**
  Simulates an external attacker trying to breach the system from the outside.

* **Focus Areas:**
  Perimeter defenses, firewall configurations, public-facing applications.

---

### 🧩 **Gray Box Testing**

* **Description:**
  The tester has limited internal knowledge, such as user-level credentials or partial architecture diagrams.

* **Use Case:**
  Mimics an insider threat or a malicious user with some access (e.g., compromised user account).

* **Focus Areas:**
  Session handling, privilege escalation, business logic flaws.

### 🧠 **White Box Testing**

* **Description:**
  The tester has full access to system documentation, source code, configurations, and internal architecture.

* **Use Case:**
  Used for in-depth security reviews, such as secure code audits and configuration validation.

* **Focus Areas:**
  Code-level vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, logic flaws, secure development practices.
