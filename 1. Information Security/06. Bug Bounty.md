# 🐞 Bug Bounty

A **Bug Bounty** is a program where companies reward individuals for finding and responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities in their software or systems. 💻🔒

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. 🏢 A company defines the scope and rules of its bug bounty program.
2. 🕵️‍♂️ Security researchers test the software or systems within the scope.
3. 📝 Vulnerabilities are submitted through a platform or direct channel.
4. ✅ The company verifies the reported issue.
5. 💰 A reward (bounty) is paid based on the severity of the vulnerability.

## ⚠️ Bug Bounty Severity Classification

In bug bounty programs, vulnerabilities are commonly categorized into five severity levels: **P1 to P5**. These help determine how urgent and impactful a reported vulnerability is.

| Severity               | Description                                                    | Impact                                                            | Response                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **P1 — Critical**      | Easily exploitable vulnerabilities with severe consequences.   | Complete system compromise, data loss, or critical business risk. | 🚨 Requires immediate action.       |
| **P2 — High**          | Vulnerabilities that can cause major damage.                   | Unauthorized access, service disruption, or major data exposure.  | ⚠️ High priority fix.               |
| **P3 — Medium**        | Moderately impactful and exploitable vulnerabilities.          | Limited data disclosure or access control issues.                 | 🛠️ Fix in the regular patch cycle. |
| **P4 — Low**           | Low-risk issues that require specific conditions.              | Minor leaks or usability concerns.                                | 🔧 Fix when feasible.               |
| **P5 — Informational** | No real security impact; may be non-exploitable or duplicates. | None or purely theoretical.                                       | ℹ️ Often no fix required.           |

summary of the **key differences between Bug Bounty and Penetration Testing** based on the image:

| **Feature**        | **Bug Bounty**                                                          | **Penetration Testing**                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Crowd-sourced vulnerability discovery program with rewards              | Formal security assessment by hired professionals          |
| **Participants**   | Public or selected external researchers (ethical hackers)               | Internal teams or third-party security firms               |
| **Scope**          | Broad, defined by program rules; often includes production systems      | Narrow, clearly defined in a contract or agreement         |
| **Duration**       | Ongoing or long-term                                                    | Time-limited (e.g., 1–4 weeks)                             |
| **Payment Model**  | Pay-per-vulnerability (bounties)                                        | Fixed price or hourly rate                                 |
| **Approach**       | Diverse methods, attacker-like, unstructured                            | Methodical, follows frameworks (e.g., OWASP, PTES)         |
| **Cost**           | Variable; can be cost-effective or unpredictable                        | Predictable; often higher fixed cost                       |
| **Use Cases**      | Continuous security feedback, catching unknown/edge-case bugs           | Compliance, internal validation, formal risk assessments   |
| **Compliance Fit** | Not usually accepted for regulatory compliance                          | Commonly required for standards like PCI-DSS, ISO 27001    |
| **Advantages**     | Continuous testing, real-world insights, diverse attacker mindset       | Structured, trusted reports, meets compliance requirements |
| **Disadvantages**  | Potential for duplicate or low-quality reports, harder to control scope | Expensive, limited frequency, depends on tester expertise  |
