# 🔐 Phases of Penetration Testing & Hacking Lifecycle

Penetration testing is a structured process used to identify, exploit, and document security vulnerabilities. It is often used to simulate real-world attacks in a legal and ethical manner.

---

## 📌 1. Planning and Scoping (Pre-engagement)

**🎯 Objective:** Define the goals, scope, and rules of engagement.

### 🔍 Key Activities:
- Understand client objectives, security policies, and compliance requirements.
- Define the scope: systems, applications, networks, APIs, physical assets.
- Identify testing boundaries (IP ranges, domains, accounts).
- Establish rules of engagement: timeframe, tools, escalation protocols.
- Obtain written authorization to ensure legality and avoid legal issues.

---

## 🕵️ 2. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

**🎯 Objective:** Collect intelligence about the target to identify potential attack vectors.

### 🧊 Passive Reconnaissance (No direct interaction):
- WHOIS lookups, DNS enumeration, social media analysis.
- Scrape metadata from documents/websites (e.g., using FOCA).

### 🔥 Active Reconnaissance (Direct interaction):
- Port scanning (e.g., Nmap), service enumeration, banner grabbing.
- Network mapping, OS fingerprinting, interrogation tools (Netcat, Shodan).

---

## 🛡️ 3. Vulnerability Analysis

**🎯 Objective:** Identify and assess weaknesses that could be exploited.

### 🧰 Key Activities:
- Perform vulnerability scans (Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys).
- Identify:
  - Misconfigurations
  - Outdated software
  - Weak credentials
  - Exposed services or APIs
- Prioritize using CVE IDs and CVSS scores.

---

## 💥 4. Exploitation

**🎯 Objective:** Exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or demonstrate impact.

### 🛠️ Key Activities:
- Execute known/custom exploits (SQLi, XSS, buffer overflows).
- Use tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLMap.
- Attempt privilege escalation (gain root/admin).
- Bypass firewalls or authentication mechanisms.

---

## 🧬 5. Post-Exploitation

**🎯 Objective:** Evaluate the extent of compromise and business impact.

### 🔎 Key Activities:
- Establish persistence (backdoors, cron jobs, startup scripts).
- Move laterally within the network (pivoting).
- Extract sensitive data (credentials, tokens, intellectual property).
- Assess impact on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

## 📝 6. Reporting

**🎯 Objective:** Document findings, exploitation steps, and remediation advice.

### 📄 Key Activities:
- Create a technical report:
  - Vulnerabilities discovered
  - Exploitation methods used
  - Systems or data accessed
- Include screenshots, logs, payloads, evidence.
- Provide remediation suggestions: patches, config fixes, best practices.
- Share technical + executive summaries.

---

## 🔁 7. Remediation Verification (Retesting)

**🎯 Objective:** Confirm that vulnerabilities have been fixed properly.

### ✅ Key Activities:
- Retest to ensure patches/configs are applied correctly.
- Validate fixes and check no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

### 🧭 Summary Flow:
```bash
Planning → Reconnaissance → Vulnerability Analysis → Exploitation → Post-Exploitation → Reporting → (Optional) Retesting

## ⚔️ Hacking vs Penetration Testing

| Phase              | Malicious Hacking               | Ethical Penetration Testing |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Reconnaissance     | Info gathering (passive/active) | Reconnaissance              |
| Scanning           | Identify open ports/services    | Vulnerability Analysis      |
| Gaining Access     | Exploit vulnerabilities         | Exploitation                |
| Maintaining Access | Install backdoors, pivot        | Post-Exploitation           |
| Covering Tracks    | Delete logs, hide traces        | ❌ Not performed ethically   |
