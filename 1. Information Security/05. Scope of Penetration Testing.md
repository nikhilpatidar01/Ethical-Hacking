# 📌 Scope of Penetration Testing

## Definition

The scope of a penetration test defines the boundaries, targets, and objectives of the engagement. It ensures that testing is effective, efficient, and conducted within legal and contractual limits.

---

## 1. Key Elements of Scope

### 1.1 Target Assets

Identify systems and components in scope. Common examples include:

* Web applications
* Internal and external networks
* Mobile applications (iOS, Android)
* APIs (REST, SOAP, GraphQL)
* Cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* IoT devices
* Wireless networks
* Social engineering (if explicitly permitted)
* Physical security (e.g., data center access)

### 1.2 Testing Boundaries

Define exclusions to avoid disruptions or legal concerns:

* Are production systems excluded?
* Are third-party components not owned by the client excluded?
* Should testing be restricted to business hours only?

### 1.3 Access Level

Specify the tester's level of access:

* **Black Box** – No prior access or credentials; simulates an external attacker
* **Gray Box** – Limited credentials or documentation; simulates an insider
* **White Box** – Full access to system internals, source code, and documentation

### 1.4 Type of Testing

Clarify what kinds of penetration testing are involved:

* **External Testing** – Focused on internet-facing systems (e.g., websites, VPNs)
* **Internal Testing** – Simulates a threat from within the network
* **Application Testing** – Focuses on business logic, session management, input validation, etc.
* **Cloud Security Assessment** – Examines IAM policies, misconfigurations, and exposed storage
* **Red Team Engagement** – Simulates real-world attacks by advanced adversaries (APTs)

### 1.5 Timeframe and Resources

Include:

* Testing start and end dates
* Daily testing windows (to minimize impact)
* Number of testers and access requirements

### 1.6 Rules of Engagement

Operational procedures must be clearly defined:

* How will vulnerabilities be reported?
* Who is the point of contact for escalation?
* What's the process for handling unexpected disruptions?

## 2. Importance of Scoping

| Benefit                   | Why It Matters                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Legal and ethical clarity | Prevents unauthorized access and potential liability |
| Resource optimization     | Ensures focus on high-risk, high-value targets       |
| Risk management           | Reduces the chance of service outages or instability |
| Reporting accuracy        | Helps ensure relevant and actionable findings        |

## 3. Example Scope Statement

> *"This penetration test will focus on the external web application [https://portal.clientsite.com](https://portal.clientsite.com), including associated APIs and authentication mechanisms. Testing will be gray-box in nature, using a test account with limited user permissions. Third-party services, internal systems, and production databases are out of scope. Testing will be performed during business hours, with daily activity reports sent to the IT security team."*

## 9. Additional Example Scope Statements

### Example 1: Internal Network Penetration Test

> *"This engagement will assess the internal corporate network located at the client's headquarters. Testing will simulate a malicious actor with access to the LAN, utilizing gray-box techniques with Active Directory domain credentials. The scope includes workstations, internal web apps, file shares, and the AD infrastructure. Production databases and employee personal devices are out of scope. Testing will take place after business hours to minimize disruption."*

### Example 2: Cloud Security Assessment

> *"The assessment will focus on the client's AWS infrastructure, specifically EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM roles, Lambda functions, and security groups. Testing will be conducted with white-box access, including IAM user credentials with read-only permissions. Other cloud platforms such as Azure or GCP are excluded. No active exploitation or privilege escalation will be performed without prior approval."*

### Example 3: Web Application & API Penetration Test

> *"This test will cover the web application [https://app.clientdomain.com](https://app.clientdomain.com) and its supporting APIs under [https://api.clientdomain.com](https://api.clientdomain.com). The assessment will be gray-box, using standard user credentials provided by the client. Administrative portals, payment gateways, and third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google Sign-In) are explicitly excluded. All testing will be performed during business hours with prior notice."*

### Example 4: Mobile App Security Testing

> *"Penetration testing will focus on the Android and iOS versions of the client's mobile banking app. The scope includes the mobile apps themselves, associated APIs, and their interaction with backend services. The engagement will use jailbroken and rooted devices for dynamic testing, and client-supplied test accounts. No testing of the production payment processor is permitted."*

### Example 5: Red Team Assessment

> *"This red team engagement will simulate an advanced persistent threat (APT) targeting the client's global infrastructure. The test will include social engineering (phishing), external reconnaissance, and lateral movement within the internal network. The scope includes all publicly available domains and internal systems reachable post-compromise. The client's Security Operations Center (SOC) will not be notified in advance, except for one POC for emergency escalation."*

### Example 6: Physical Security Test

> *"This physical penetration test will assess the security posture of the client’s primary data center located in San Jose, CA. The assessment will attempt to bypass physical access controls (badges, locks, guards) and access sensitive areas (server rooms, network closets). All tests will be conducted during working hours under a gray-box approach with basic facility maps. Employee areas and non-IT buildings are excluded from the test."*
